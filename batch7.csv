Brown M.A.",Park Street Press," Reveals evidence of visionary plants in Christianity and the life of Jesus found in medieval art and biblical scripture--hidden in plain sight for centuries• Follows the authors’ anthropological adventure discovering sacred mushroom images in European and Middle Eastern churches, including Roslyn Chapel and Chartres• Provides color photos showing how R. Gordon Wasson’s psychedelic theory of religion clearly extends to Christianity and reveals why Wasson suppressed this information due to his secret relationship with the Vatican• Examines the Bible and the Gnostic Gospels to show that visionary plants were the catalyst for Jesus’s awakening to his divinity and immortalityThroughout medieval Christianity, religious works of art emerged to illustrate the teachings of the Bible for the largely illiterate population. What, then, is the significance of the psychoactive mushrooms hiding in plain sight in the artwork and icons of many European and Middle-Eastern churches? Does Christianity have a psychedelic history?Providing stunning visual evidence from their anthropological journey throughout Europe and the Middle East, including visits to Roslyn Chapel and Chartres Cathedral, authors Julie and Jerry Brown document the role of visionary plants in Christianity. They retrace the pioneering research of R. Gordon Wasson, the famous “sacred mushroom seeker,” on psychedelics in ancient Greece and India, and among the present-day reindeer herders of Siberia and the Mazatecs of Mexico. Challenging Wasson’s legacy, the authors reveal his secret relationship with the Vatican that led to Wasson’s refusal to pursue his hallucinogen theory into the hallowed halls of Christianity.Examining the Bible and the Gnostic Gospels, the authors provide scriptural support to show that sacred mushrooms were the inspiration for Jesus’ revelation of the Kingdom of Heaven and that he was initiated into these mystical practices in Egypt during the Missing Years. They contend that the Trees of Knowledge and of Immortality in Eden were sacred mushrooms.Uncovering the role played by visionary plants in the origins of Judeo-Christianity, the authors invite us to rethink what we know about the life of Jesus and to consider a controversial theory that challenges us to explore these sacred pathways to the divine.",$16.95,4.6

[A] rich portrait of ancient Egypt’s complex evolution over the course of three millenniums.”—Los Angeles Times   NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Washington Post • Publishers Weekly   In this landmark volume, one of the world’s most renowned Egyptologists tells the epic story of this great civilization, from its birth as the first nation-state to its absorption into the Roman Empire. Drawing upon forty years of archaeological research, award-winning scholar Toby Wilkinson takes us inside a tribal society with a pre-monetary economy and decadent, divine kings who ruled with all-too-recognizable human emotions. Here are the legendary leaders: Akhenaten, the “heretic king,” who with his wife Nefertiti brought about a revolution with a bold new religion; Tutankhamun, whose dazzling tomb would remain hidden for three millennia; and eleven pharaohs called Ramesses, the last of whom presided over the militarism, lawlessness, and corruption that caused a political and societal decline. Filled with new information and unique interpretations, The Rise and Fall of Ancient Egypt is a riveting and revelatory work of wild drama, bold spectacle, unforgettable characters, and sweeping history.   “With a literary flair and a sense for a story well told, Mr. Wilkinson offers a highly readable, factually up-to-date account.”—The Wall Street Journal   “[Wilkinson] writes with considerable verve. . . . [He] is nimble at conveying the sumptuous pageantry and cultural sophistication of pharaonic Egypt.”—The New York Times",$19.55,4.3

48011,022656505X,book,paperback,"Plotinus: Myth, Metaphor, and Philosophical Practice",Stephen R. L. Clark,University Of Chicago Press," Plotinus, the Roman philosopher (c. 204-270 CE) who is widely regarded as the founder of Neoplatonism, was also the creator of numerous myths, images, and metaphors. They have influenced both secular philosophers and Christian and Muslim theologians, but have frequently been dismissed by modern scholars as merely ornamental. In this book, distinguished philosopher Stephen R. L. Clark shows that they form a vital set of spiritual exercises by which individuals can achieve one of Plotinus’s most important goals: self-transformation through contemplation.             Clark examines a variety of Plotinus’s myths and metaphors within the cultural and philosophical context of his time, asking probing questions about their contemplative effects. What is it, for example, to “think away the spatiality” of material things? What state of mind is Plotinus recommending when he speaks of love, or drunkenness, or nakedness? What star-like consciousness is intended when he declares that we were once stars or are stars eternally? What does it mean to say that the soul goes around God? And how are we supposed to “bring the god in us back to the god in all”? Through these rich images and structures, Clark casts Plotinus as a philosopher deeply concerned with philosophy as a way of life. ",$34.83,5.0

Dow,IVP Academic," Templeton Foundation Character Project's Character Essay and Book Prize Competition award winner! What does it mean to love God with all of our minds? Our culture today is in a state of crisis where intellectual virtue is concerned. Dishonesty, cheating, arrogance, laziness, cowardice--such vices are rampant in society, even among the worlds most prominent leaders. We find ourselves in an ethical vacuum, as the daily headlines of our newspapers confirm again and again. Central to the problem is the state of education. We live in a technological world that has ever greater access to new information and yet no idea what to do with it all. In this wise and winsome book, Philip Dow presents a case for the recovery of intellectual character. He explores seven key virtues--courage, carefulness, tenacity, fair-mindedness, curiosity, honesty and humility--and discusses their many benefits. The recovery of virtue, Dow argues, is not about doing the right things, but about becoming the right kind of person. The formation of intellectual character produces a way of life that demonstrates love for both God and neighbor. Dow has written an eminently practical guide to a life of intellectual virtue designed especially for parents and educators. The book concludes with seven principles for a true education, a discussion guide for university and church groups, and nine appendices that provide examples from Dows experience as a teacher and administrator. Virtuous Minds is a timely and thoughtful work for parents and pastors, teachers and students--anyone who thinks education is more about the quality of character than about the quantity of facts.",$14.88,4.3

Their music is an integral, indelible part of many of Disney's classic films, shows, and theme park attractions. But for the Shermans, success was not always just a dream away.The story of the Sherman Brothers might have sprung from a stock Disney plot: after long struggles and numerous failures, a serendipitous event brought them fame, fortune, and happiness. That event was their first meeting with Walt Disney, a meeting which they left with their heads hanging, as Walt's only comment about the song they played for them was: ""That'll work.""In Walt-speak, however, ""that'll work"" was high praise indeed, and the Shermans (or ""the boys"", as Walt called them) went on to create a musical legacy that millions of Disney fans just can't get out of their heads.In this well-researched biography, Kathryn Price traces the lives of the Shermans, from their unsettled childhood as the sons of a Tin Pan Alley songwriter and their early failure to replicate his success, to their chart-topping but surprisingly short collaboration with Walt Disney and the long coda to their careers after Walt's death and the transformation of the Disney company into a disharmony they could not tolerate.",$17.95,5.0

The author believes that to fully understand Springsteen's recorded work it is necessary to understand the formative years that shaped him. It covers:* The genealogy of the Springsteen family from earliest times.* Relationships with his managers - how whenever success beckoned he would move in a new direction.* The development of his drive to sound like Van Morrison and Joe Cocker (in the Bruce Springsteen Band).* The importance of his booking agent, Sam Keith.* The fight to get support from Columbia Records. * How a Brown University student saved his career.* How the musicians changed the rules to all-night Monopoly sessions. This book covers the year from Springsteen's birth to 1974 - the year before his breakthrough album Born To Run. It explores both the negative factors in his life such as school and Catholicism and the positive ones such as baseball, girls and the guitar, as well as the British Invasion, the civil rights movement and, crucially, his relationship with his father. Springsteen's early bands, the Rogues, the Castiles and Earth, are examined via interviews with ex-members.

48037,1626259690,book,paperback,The Kindness Cure: How the Science of Compassion Can Heal Your Heart and Your World,"Tara Cousineau PhD, Stephen Post PhD",New Harbinger Publications," It’s time for a kindness revolution. In The Kindness Cure, psychologist Tara Cousineau draws on cutting-edge research in psychology and neuroscience to show how simple practices of kindness—for ourselves, for others, and for our world—can dissolve our feelings of fear and indifference, and open us up to a life of profound happiness.Compassion for ourselves and others is our birthright as humans—hardwired into our DNA and essential to our happiness. But in our fast-paced, technical savvy and hyper competitive world, it may come as no surprise that rates of narcissism have risen, while empathy levels have declined. We now find ourselves in a “cool to be cruel” culture where it’s easy to feel disillusioned and dejected in our hearts, homes, and communities. So, how can we reverse this malady of meanness and make kindness and compassion an imperative?The Kindness Cure draws on the latest social and scientific research to reveal how the seemingly “soft skills” of kindness, cooperation, and generosity are fundamental to our survival as a species. In fact, it’s our prosocial abilities that put us at the head of the line. Blended with moving case studies and clinical anecdotes, Cousineau offers practical ways to rekindle kindness from the inside out.We are wired to care. The very existence of our human species evolved because of an intricate physiology built for empathy, compassion, and cooperation. Yet we have an epidemic of loneliness, indifference, and cruelty, and we see these destructive trends on a daily basis in our families, schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces. This important book teaches effective skills in compassion, mindfulness, and social and emotional learning, and reveals successful social policy initiatives in empathy taking place that inform everything from family life to education to the workplace.Kindness has the exponential power to renew relationships and transform how we think, feel, and behave in the world.

But why do the names of Indonesia’s own scientists rarely appear in the annals of scientific history? In The Floracrats Andrew Goss examines the professional lives of Indonesian naturalists and biologists, to show what happens to science when a powerful state becomes its greatest, and indeed only, patron. Â Â  Â With only one purse to pay for research, Indonesia’s scientists followed a state agenda focused mainly on exploiting the country’s most valuable natural resourcesâabove all its major export crops: quinine, sugar, coffee, tea, rubber, and indigo. The result was a class of botanic bureaucrats that Goss dubs the “floracrats.” Drawing on archives and oral histories, he shows how these scientists strove for the Enlightenment ideal of objective, universal, and useful knowledge, even as they betrayed that ideal by failing to share scientific knowledge with the general public. With each chapter, Goss details the phases of power and the personalities in Indonesia that have struggled with this dilemma, from the early colonial era, through independence, to the modern Indonesian state. Goss shows just how limiting dependence on an all-powerful state can be for a scientific community, no matter how idealistic its individual scientists may be.",$23.84,

48050,801419328,book,paperback,Mighty Empire-Origins am CB,Marc Egnal,Cornell University Press," First published in 1988, Marc Egnal's now classic revisionist history of the origins of the American Revolution, focuses on five colonies―Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina―from 1700 to the post-Revolutionary era. Egnal asserts that throughout colonial America the struggle against Great Britain was led by an upper-class faction motivated by a vision of the rapid development of the New World.In each colony the membership of this group, which Egnal calls the expansionist faction, was shaped by self-interest, religious convictions, and national origins. According to Egnal, these individuals had long shown a commitment to American growth and had fervently supported the colonial wars against France, Spain, and Native Americans. While advancing this interpretation, Egnal explores several salient aspects of colonial society. He scrutinizes the partisan battles within the provinces and argues that they were in fact clashes between the expansionists and a second long-lived faction that he calls the ""nonexpansionists.""Through close analysis he shows how economic crisis―the depression of the 1760s―influenced the colonists' behavior. And although he focuses on the initiative and leadership of the elite, Egnal also investigates the part played by the common people in the rebellion. A Mighty Empire contains insightful sketches of Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and other revolutionary leaders and makes clear the human dimensions of the clash with Great Britain. The final chapter provides a new context for understanding the writing of the Constitution and considers the links between the Revolution and modern America. An appendix lists members of the colonial factions and identifies their patterns of political commitment.Now back in print with a new preface, A Mighty Empire is a valuable addition to the debate over the role of ideas and interests in shaping the Revolution. For the 2010 edition, Egnal reviews how interpretations of the American Revolution have developed since the publication of his landmark volume. In his new preface he considers and critiques explanations for the Revolution founded on ideology, the role of non-elite Americans, and British politics. Egnal also looks to a trend in the writing of the history of the Revolution that considers its effects more than its causes and thereby grapple with the conflicts ingredient in the nascent American empire. With great lucidity, he shows where the writing of history has gone since the appearance of A Mighty Empire and makes a case for its continuing relevance.",$39.95,

The Sultan has commissioned a cadre of the most acclaimed artists in the land to create a great book celebrating the glories of his realm. Their task: to illuminate the work in the European style. But because figurative art can be deemed an affront to Islam, this commission is a dangerous proposition indeed. The ruling elite therefore mustn’t know the full scope or nature of the project, and panic erupts when one of the chosen miniaturists disappears. The only clue to the mystery–or crime? –lies in the half-finished illuminations themselves.

Some gathered to pledge their support for the government of President John Adams, others to express their disdain for his policies. Violence, both physical and political, threatened the safety of the city and the Union itself. To combat the chaos and protect the nation from both external and internal threats, the Federalists swiftly enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts. Oppressive pieces of legislation aimed at separating so-called genuine patriots from objects of suspicion, these acts sought to restrict political speech, whether spoken or written, soberly planned or drunkenly off-the-cuff. Little more than twenty years after Americans declared independence and less than ten since they ratified both a new constitution and a bill of rights, the acts gravely limited some of the very rights those bold documents had promised to protect.In The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, Terri Diane Halperin discusses the passage of these laws and the furor over them, as well as the difficulties of enforcement. She describes in vivid detail the heated debates and tempestuous altercations that erupted between partisan opponents: one man pulled a gun on a supporter of the act in a churchyard; congressmen were threatened with arrest for expressing their opinions; and printers were viciously beaten for distributing suspect material. She also introduces readers to the fraught political divisions of the late 1790s, explores the effect of immigration on the new republic, and reveals the dangers of partisan excess throughout history.Touching on the major sedition trials while expanding the discussion beyond the usual focus on freedom of speech and the press to include the treatment of immigrants, Halperin’s book provides a window through which readers can explore the meaning of freedom of speech, immigration, citizenship, the public sphere, the Constitution, and the Union.",$19.08,5.0

Wear the new purple basque – no knickers. Expect some SERIOUS (!) paddling. No touching until then. Master. Beth hurriedly hides the note she has received so her family won’t see it. Her daughter regards her parents as stuck in the mud. If only she knew! When Beth decided to throw off her inhibitions she was able to thoroughly enjoy her middle years, despite the usual body issues, including attending a BDSM event and starting a relationship with a Dom. Putting on her purple bustier and high heels as ordered, and covering up with a coat, she leaves her husband engrossed in his carpentry workshop to walk to a neighbour’s house. This is the home of swinging couple, Alistair and Helen, with whom she’s had several encounters over the past year. And this begins a wonderful evening of kink—bondage, spanking, paddling, handcuffs, and orgasm denial. Then her husband turns up. BDSM Weekend: Wanting variety in your sexual lust? Then come to Lindsey Park Manor. A weekend of BDSM activities for beginners. That was what James Shaw had booked at Lindsey Park Manor. He was now anxious about telling his wife, Caroline. In the past, they had tried out various implements at home, and were keen to take it further—even considering joining a ‘swingers’ site—but it was quite daunting doing anything with others! And then a shock awaits them on arrival in the form of James’ best friend. As they progress through the various events—cropping in the stables, fellatio in the ballroom, and an unusual fox hunt—they have to deal with animosity, jealousy and the dropping of inhibitions, as all of them grow in their knowledge of a lifestyle which is exciting, yet challenging. Just as the dynamics of their threesome change considerably, a further surprise awaits them at the end of the weekend.

48073,1101984325,book,paperback,The Man Who Wasn't There: Tales from the Edge of the Self,Anil Ananthaswamy,Dutton," In the tradition of Oliver Sacks, science journalist Anil Ananthaswamy skillfully inspects the bewildering connections among brain, body, mind, self, and society by examining a range of neuropsychological ailments from autism and Alzheimer’s to out-of-body experiences and body integrity identity disorder Award-winning science writer Anil Ananthaswamy smartly explores the concept of self by way of several mental conditions that eat away at patients’ identities, showing we learn a lot about being human from people with a fragmented or altered sense of self. Ananthaswamy travelled the world to meet those who suffer from “maladies of the self” interviewing patients, psychiatrists, philosophers and neuroscientists along the way. He charts how the self is affected by Asperger’s, autism, Alzheimer’s, epilepsy, schizophrenia, among many other mental conditions, revealing how the brain constructs our sense of self. Each chapter is anchored with stories of people who experience themselves differently from the norm. Readers meet individuals in various stages of Alzheimer’s disease where the loss of memory and cognition results in the loss of some aspects of the self. We meet a woman who recalls the feeling of her first major encounter with schizophrenia which she describes as an outside force controlling her.  Ananthaswamy also looks at several less­ familiar conditions, such as Cotard’s syndrome, in which patients believe they are dead, and those with body integrity identity disorder, where the patient seeks to have a body part amputated because it “doesn’t belong to them.” Moving nimbly back and forth from the individual stories to scientific analysis The Man Who Wasn’t There is a wholly original exploration of the human self which raises fascinating questions about the mind-body connection.   ",$12.96,4.1

In Holy Subversion, Trevin Wax challenges such behavior by urging a return to the subversive lifestyle of the earliest Christians. Their proclamation and demonstration that ""Jesus is Lord"" directly opposed the Caesar worship of their day. Today, Christians in the West must choose between Jesus and our ""Caesars"": self, success, money, leisure, sex, power. What would it look like, asks Wax, if today's church reclaimed the communal, subversive nature of the gospel, intentionally undermining all contenders for our devotion? How would the message that ""Jesus is Lord"" change our thinking about our jobs, our families, and our church participation? Here this gifted pastor-theologian offers help in taking our faith public, dethroning modern-day Caesars, honoring the Lordship of Christ, and understanding the church as the ultimate counterculture-an embodiment of Christ's supremacy over all.",$11.89,4.5

If you said advertising, think again. People don’t listen to advertisements, they listen to their peers. But why do people talk about certain products and ideas more than others? Why are some stories and rumors more infectious? And what makes online content go viral?  Wharton marketing professor Jonah Berger has spent the last decade answering these questions. He’s studied why New York Times articles make the paper’s own Most E-mailed list, why products get word of mouth, and how social influence shapes everything from the cars we buy to the clothes we wear to the names we give our children.  In Contagious, Berger reveals the secret science behind word-of-mouth and social transmission. Discover how six basic principles drive all sorts of things to become contagious, from consumer products and policy initiatives to workplace rumors and YouTube videos. Learn how a luxury steakhouse found popularity through the lowly cheesesteak, why anti-drug commercials might have actually increased drug use, and why more than 200 million consumers shared a video about one of the most seemingly boring products there is: a blender. Contagious provides a set of specific, actionable techniques for helping information spread—for designing messages, advertisements, and content that people will share. Whether you’re a manager at a big company, a small business owner trying to boost awareness, a politician running for office, or a health official trying to get the word out, Contagious will show you how to make your product or idea catch on.",$10.87,4.5

While that’s part of it, worship is the essence of what makes us truly human. God sparked this desire within our hearts from the day He first breathed life into Adam and Eve. Since then, every single human who has walked this planet has participated in this God-given ability, and divine quest. While many have squandered their gift, there are those who find the wonder-filled life of communion with God no matter the time or place.    True freedom comes when worship flows through us as naturally as the air we breathe, when the words and actions in our lives resonate with our Creator so deeply that every inhalation is full of meaning. When we understand the holiness of the God who knows the stars by name—and His overwhelming love for each one of us—how can we offer anything less?   In The Air I Breathe, Louie Giglio explains in passionate prose what it means to truly live a life of worship, offering insight and guidance for finding our personal path towards connecting with the God of the Universe.   ",$13.49,4.7

Seconded to a military-religious order he's barely heard of - part of the baroque hierarchy of the Mercatoria, the latest galactic hegemony - Fassin Taak has to travel again amongst the Dwellers. He is in search of a secret hidden for half a billion years. But with each day that passes a war draws closer - a war that threatens to overwhelm everything and everyone he's ever known. As complex, turbulent, flamboyant and spectacular as the gas giant on which it is set, the new science fiction novel from Iain M. Banks is space opera on a truly epic scale.",$13.69,3.9

A perky werewolf from the Chicago Loop. Polar opposites, each looking for a fire to ward off winter’s chill… Maxim Chernov isn’t a man of half measures. After a string of personal tragedies, he left everything behind to become an arctic bush pilot. A rugged refrigerator of a man, he now spends his days content in solitude, delivering mail and supplies to the remotest corners of the Alaskan tundra. When he’s not piloting his ski-plane, or grabbing a drink in the tiny town of Yakutak, the gruff shifter roams the wilds in his other, more comfortable skin: that of a giant kodiak bear. He’s not lonely, he reminds himself constantly; solitude suits him just fine. Some days, he almost believes it. Piper O’Malley, an up-and-coming young werewolf from downtown Chicago, wishes her pack leader would recognize her real value to the organization. She struggles to climb the corporate ladder of urban shifter society, clawing her way toward more responsibility and more important assignments while putting her personal relationships on hold. One day she’ll find true love, she tells herself in between flight delays and full moons. Some days, she almost believes it. By the time Piper hitches a late night ride into Yakutak, she’s sporting nothing but her wits, her gear, and a hastily scrawled out contact: the name of a local bush pilot who’s said to be sympathetic to shifter causes. A small, remote silver mining operation—owned and operated by her pack—has gone completely dark, and unraveling the mystery could be exactly the big break Piper needs. Although eager to prove herself, she won’t get far without Maxim’s help. Together, this unlikely pair of shifters will face subzero temperatures and supernatural horrors in the Land of the Midnight Sun. While struggling to survive the coming storms, they might even kindle a new flame — in each other’s arms. This full-length, standalone novel is the first tale set in Lucy Lachance’s Second City Shifters universe. As you follow the blossoming of a steamy relationship between two breeds of shifters from two different worlds, expect urban fantasy flavor, no cliffhangers, and the HEA ending romance readers know and love.

Fighting against the Fascists, he described in painfully vivid and occasionally comic detail life in the trenches—with a “democratic army” composed of men with no ranks, no titles, and often no weapons—and his near fatal wounding. As the politics became tangled, Orwell was pulled into a heartbreaking conflict between his own personal ideals and the complicated realities of political power struggles.   Considered one of the finest works by a man V. S. Pritchett called “the wintry conscience of a generation,” Homage to Catalonia is both Orwell’s memoir of his experiences at the front and his tribute to those who died in what he called a fight for common decency. This edition features a new foreword by Adam Hochschild placing the war in greater context and discussing the evolution of Orwell’s views on the Spanish Civil War.   “No one except George Orwell . . . made the violence and self-dramatization of Spain so burning and terrible.”— Alfred Kazin, New York Times   “A wise book, one that once read will never be forgotten.”—Chicago Sunday Tribune",$11.94,4.3

48135,1499252331,book,paperback,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn: Original & Unabridged,Mark Twain,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," This is the original and unabridged text of the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain. It is commonly named among the Great American Novels.The book is noted for its colorful description of people and places along the Mississippi River. Set in a Southern society that had ceased to exist about twenty years before the work was published.Huck struggles not only with the challenges of his strenuous journey, but also with the 19th century social climate and the role it forces on him regarding the slave Jim. Throughout the story, Huck is in moral conflict with the received values of the society in which he lives, and while he is unable to consciously refute those values even in his thoughts, he makes a moral choice based on his own valuation of Jim's friendship and human worth, a decision in direct opposition to the things he has been taught.Mark Twain, in his lecture notes, proposes that ""a sound heart is a surer guide than an ill-trained conscience"" and goes on to describe the novel as ""...a book of mine where a sound heart and a deformed conscience come into collision and conscience suffers defeat"".Twain began his career writing light, humorous verse, but evolved into a chronicler of the vanities, hypocrisies and murderous acts of mankind. At mid-career, with Huckleberry Finn, he combined rich humor, sturdy narrative and social criticism. Twain was a master at rendering colloquial speech and helped to create and popularize a distinctive American literature built on American themes and language. ""Mark Twain gave pleasure – real intellectual enjoyment – to millions, and his works will continue to give such pleasure to millions yet to come ... His humor was American, but he was nearly as much appreciated by Englishmen and people of other countries as by his own countrymen. He has made an enduring part of American literature."" &emdash;President William Howard Taft",$11.25,4.3

I loved every minute of it.' Pretty Little Book Reviews Jenny has too much on her plate: literally – she’s only expecting one child but she’s eating for at least three. Not to mention trying to juggle her nightmare boss, a know-it-all sister, and an infuriatingly laid-back husband. She used to be known for her ‘Single Girl About Town’ column. But when her boss gives her job to a younger colleague, Jenny panics and proposes she blogs instead about being a clueless new mum. Surely people will find her new friendship group fascinating? (Even if the only thing they seem to have in common is that they all had sex around the same time 9 months ago...)  And if her readers aren’t quite hooked yet, maybe Jenny will just have to be more liberal with the truth. After all, none of the other mums will read it… will they?  The Undercover Mother is a hilarious parenting page-turner that will make you laugh, cry and want to crack open the gin. Perfect for fans of Why Mummy Drinks and The Bad Mother’s Diary.  What readers are saying about The Undercover Mother 'The book is hilarious and fun.' Life After Twenty Seven, 5 stars 'Oh my days. I loved this book... The Undercover Mother is certainly in parts a laugh out loud read, it's also a comfort read, sometimes happy, funny and sometimes a little sad, the book has lots of emotion running through it...Antenatal classes should stop giving leaflets, pamphlets, brochures out at classes, and give this book out. Told as it is. I could relate to so much of this from when I was a new mum... Winging it, thinking everyone else has their sh*t together, and there is only you in the world that isn't managing everything...  First Class read, I recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun, yet real read. Friendships, secrets, lies, revelations, laughter, tears, relationships. This book covers it all.

Alternating between personal anecdotes from his spring 2017 walking pilgrimage and other ""traveler"" encounters and episodes told by Thoreau, Dann structures his book around 12 ""injunctions""--distillations of seminal stories about overcoming convention and stasis.

Through his synthesis of a broad range of scientific research with applications to everyday life, Dr. Siegel has developed novel approaches that have helped hundreds of patients. And now he has written the first book that will help all of us understand the potential we have to create our own lives. Showing us mindsight in action, Dr. Siegel describes • a sixteen-year-old boy with bipolar disorder who uses meditation and other techniques instead of drugs to calm the emotional storms that made him suicidal• a woman paralyzed by anxiety, who uses mindsight to discover, in an unconscious memory of a childhood accident, the source of her dread• a physician–the author himself–who pays attention to his intuition, which he experiences as a ""vague, uneasy feeling in my belly, a gnawing restlessness in my heart and my gut,"" and tracks down a patient who could have gone deaf because of an inaccurately written prescription for an ear infection• a twelve-year-old girl with OCD who learns a meditation that is ""like watching myself from outside myself"" and, using a form of internal dialogue, is able to stop the compulsive behaviors that have been tormenting herThese and many other extraordinary stories illustrate how mindsight can help us master our emotions, heal our relationships, and reach our fullest potential.",$14.45,4.5

Claudia Kitterman, a beautiful powerhouse, completely unnerves her, and when Claudia sets her green-eyed sights on Kate, every self-preserving belief Kate possesses about life, people, and herself gets challenged. Sometimes the seemingly mismatched end up being the perfect match.It's romance, angst, humor, and a guaranteed happy ending -- in true Kate and Claudia style. Author's Note: Each of the books in the Lesbian Adventure Club series has a plot. Each begins and ends to form a complete package.There is a larger plot, however, one that encompasses the entire series. This comes in the form of character development, the character arc. As they experience different things, they struggle, they face their demons, they learn, they grow, and sometimes they backslide -- just as you and I do.In my estimation, the backstory contained in this book will alter your experience of reading the Lesbian Adventure Club series. It will change the unfolding of that larger plot because you will become privy to character information not revealed until later books.With this in mind, I strongly suggest (hope, pray, beg) that The Queen of Terrified & The Newly Brave Landowner not be read until you have followed the characters' natural course of development through at least book eight, L-Word C-Word. I believe this will preserve the intent of the series. It has been and will continue to be character-driven. For experience's sake, let them drive. Sample: The first two chapters can be read on LesbianAdventureClub.com.",$11.99,5.0

48183,1439160414,book,paperback,Barack Obama: The Story,David Maraniss,Simon & Schuster," From the author of First in His Class, the definitive biography of Bill Clinton, this New York Times bestseller was hailed by critics as a groundbreaking multigenerational biography, a richly textured account of President Obama and the forces that shaped him and sustain him. In Barack Obama: The Story, David Maraniss has written a deeply reported generational biography teeming with fresh insights and revealing information, a masterly narrative drawn from hundreds of interviews, including with President Obama in the Oval Office, and a trove of letters, journals, diaries, and other documents. The book unfolds in the small towns of Kansas and the remote villages of western Kenya, following the personal struggles of Obama’s white and black ancestors through the swirl of the twentieth century. It is a roots story on a global scale, a saga of constant movement, frustration and accomplishment, strong women and weak men, hopes lost and deferred, people leaving and being left. Disparate family threads converge in the climactic chapters as Obama reaches adulthood and travels from Honolulu to Los Angeles to New York to Chicago, trying to make sense of his past, establish his own identity, and prepare for his political future. Barack Obama: The Story chronicles as never before the forces that shaped the first black president of the United States and explains why he thinks and acts as he does. Much like the author’s classic study of Bill Clinton, First in His Class, this promises to become a seminal book that will redefine a president.",$7.36,3.7

In this ground-breaking book, world renowned creativity expert Ken Robinson identifies a crisis in education and business: whether it's a child bored in class, a disillusioned or misused employee or someone who feels frustrated but can't quite explain why, too many people don't realize what they are capable of achieving. Through stories of people - like Vidal Sassoon, Ariana Huffington and Matt Groening - who have recognized their unique talents and been able to make a successful living doing what they love, Robinson argues that age and occupation are no barrier and explains how it is possible for each one of us to reach our element. With a wry sense of humour, Ken Robinson inspires us, above all, to reconnect with our true self - it could just change everything.",$9.99,4.3

48187,1905624522,book,paperback,Great Lengths: The Swimming Pools of Britain (Played in Britain),"Ian Gordon, Simon Inglis",English Heritage," Swimming is Britain’s most popular participation sport. Nearly one in four people swim at least once a month, with around 80 million visits to swimming pools recorded every year. Surprisingly, although public baths have formed a vital part of community life since an 1846 Act of Parliament, their story has never been told in book form until now. Great Lengths, the eighth book in the acclaimed Played in Britain series, traces the development of indoor public baths and pools, from the earliest subscription baths of the Georgian period and the first municipal baths in Liverpool in 1829, to the current generation of leisure pools with their flumes and potted palm trees. In both the public and private sectors the golden era of pool design fell between the 1880s and 1914, when over 600 baths were constructed, many rich in architectural detail and technological innovation. The magnificent Victoria Baths in Manchester completed in 1906 (2003 winner of BBC2 Restoration series) set new standards for opulence. Birmingham’s Balsall Heath Baths (1907), London’s Haggerston Baths (1904) and similar establishments in Hull, Nottingham and Glasgow equally reflected the civic pride of their creators, as greater awareness of hygiene and physical fitness brought safe swimming and recreation to the urban masses. A further burst of activity between the wars saw a new generation of concrete and glass Art Deco baths and in the 1960s these were joined by classic Modern designs. Great Lengths is no mere exercise in nostalgia. Scores of Victorian and Edwardian baths have been allowed to deteriorate. Dozens remain closed and the subject of long running campaigns for restoration. Yet many modern baths built in the late 20th century have also been found wanting. For this reason, this book will serve as an important reference for anyone involved in the current debate, whether as swimmers or providers.",$12.50,

There are nearly 300,000 traffic signals today in the United States. Each traffic signal performs the task of regulating whose turn it is to go and who must wait. A traffic signal system at its core has two major tasks: move as many users through the intersection as possible and do it with as little conflict between these users as possible. The first task relates to efficiency and capacity while the second relates to safety. Both tasks are performed by first clearly defining which group of users has the right of way at a given time and second by determining how long the group has the right of way. The content in this book is targeted at a senior or graduate level university course in transportation engineering and focuses on the design and operation of one important part of the traffic signal control system: the isolated intersection. Some of the material in this book may also be appropriate for portions of advanced classes in transportation engineering.  Educational research points to a hands-on active learning environment as the best approach to improving student understanding of important concepts. Unlike many courses that emphasize an instructor focus (with lectures presented to students), this book emphasizes a student focus in which you will learn by doing an experiment, analyzing data that you collect, and drawing conclusions about what makes good signal timing practice. This approach requires a more active preparation for each class on your part and a readiness to actively participate in the work of each class. This focus on you means more work but it rewards you with the potential for deeper learning and understanding of this material. This book is divided into 10 chapters and includes 63 activities. The first four chapters of the book provide a base level of knowledge. Chapters 5 through 9 address specific system components, providing first an understanding of how these components function and second how to design them. Finally, Chapter 10 integrates the components together into a final design in which you prepare a report and make a presentation covering your work.  Most chapters have a similar structure. Each chapter begins with a Reading that provides important information on the topics covered in the chapter. A series of activities follow, each providing hands-on experiences with the chapter topic.  Assessment activities give you the chance to test and apply what you learned in the readingDiscovery activities provide you with the opportunity to discover new factors or perspectives about the chapter topic by observing animations, collecting or analyzing data, or making calculationsField activities allow you to explore traffic flow and control conditions directly in the field and connect your field observations with the theory that you learned in other activitiesDesign activities allow you to determine one component of your design and evaluate its performanceIn Practice activities give you the opportunity to compare your understanding or design component with recommended practice from the Traffic Signal Timing Manual",$48.00,4.3

You’ll learn how to asses your current self-esteem and identify the roadblocks that are holding you back from loving yourself. Then, you’ll learn how to transform that negativity into positivity. . Embrace healthy diet, exercise, and self-care We’re constantly told that to be a good person, we have to focus entirely on others and never ourselves. That’s a common misconception, and what ends up happening is we push ourselves so hard that we become drained of life, and have nothing to offer others. If you really care about loving others, you have to love yourself, first. This book provides a path on how to treat yourself as you treat others, including better diet, exercise, and always beginning the day with self-love. That can include journaling and treating yourself to something you enjoy. You also want to be kind to yourself, and only consume positive media, books, and TV. Only surround yourself with what encourages you There are obstacles to self-love, so it’s important to get rid of as many of them as possible. Surround yourself with friends and family who encourage you, and don’t bring you down. Think carefully about your friends and if there’s someone who always has harmful words for you, avoid spending time with them or giving them the opportunity to criticize you. Some people don’t even realize what they’re doing, so have conversations with these friends about how they treat you. Have the same conversation with yourself, if necessary. Many people harbor guilt and bitterness against themselves, so learn how to forgive and forget.

Setting goals for yourself is an important part of the process, and focusing on small things you can do every day to improve your self-esteem. You’ll start to see positive results like more energy, less depressive episodes, and just a lighter sense of being. Be sure to reward yourself for your progress, and celebrate every victory as it comes. Learning to say “no” One of the hardest parts of self-care is saying “no,” whether it’s to negative influences or people. This book will explore how to say “no” well, and what happens afterwards. Body image and the media A common variation of self-hatred is hatred of your own body. The media has been an incredibly destructive force, and forces the idea of what “perfect” is. This book will break down signs that you may have a body image problem, and what to do about it. Part of loving yourself is loving the skin you’re in, and loving yourself as a whole. Love yourself for a week, for 30 days, and beyond! Let this book be your guide to self-love and self-care every step of the way. It isn’t a selfish, or foolish endeavor.

Blaine Faulkner,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," There are thousands of financial resources for those with a 9-to-5 job and boxes of well-kept tax records. Although the US FBI estimates that a full 40% of the world's economy is ""off the books"", there just isn't an easy way to find an ask-no-questions accountant. Until now, those of us with unpopular, questionable, or outright illicit sources of income had no guide whatsoever. Fortunately the Black Hats of the world have already charted a clear path in this area out of their own necessity. Black Hat Banking is a guide for anyone that has a need to keep their income private, without sacrificing the security of their assets. Black Hat Banking is more than just a guide to offshore banking and asset protection. Here you'll discover the full breadth of the US and International financial surveillance network and learn how to avoid invasions of privacy and unwanted scrutiny. By utilizing the latest crypto-currencies and all manner of loopholes in the system, you too can secure your wealth as professional hackers do. Along with a complete explanation of how high-end hackers and organized crime operate, the author dispels misconceptions regarding large cash transactions and reporting requirements for banks, while establishing best practices for entrepreneurs concerned with their financial privacy. Reader beware: this is not a book that toes the line of political correctness, nor does it pay homage to the concept of American Exceptionalism. Black Hat Banking begins with the assumption that there are those of us that simply cannot trust traditional banking systems, especially those influenced by big government interest. With a more international worldview the author offers a map to safe offshore banking and simple asset protection techniques. Black Hat Banking is written by M. Blaine Faulkner, AKA CygonX, one of the world’s most infamous cybercriminals. As the man was once an international fugitive on both INTERPOL's and the FBI's most wanted list, his writing reflects his personal experience with law enforcement and his ongoing asset protection techniques. This book destroys naive worldviews regarding benevolent governments with their citizen's best interest in mind; not a book for the American Middle Class. This book has a singular focus of financial privacy at all costs, with the Libertarian idea that anyone has the potential to be an international citizen, and the right to manage their own wealth free, of government regulation and manipulation. If you have a need to secure your finances outside of traditional banking systems, this book is for you.",$12.99,

They were stunned by the feudal conditions they found in Hawaii, where the majority of workers―Hawaiian, Japanese, Chinese, and Filipino in origin―were routinely subjected to repression and racism at the hands of white bosses.The wartime civil liberties crackdown brought union organizing to a halt; but as the war wound down, Hawaii workers’ frustrations boiled over, leading to an explosive success in the forming of unions. During the 1950s, just as the ILWU began a series of successful strikes and organizing drives, the union came under McCarthyite attacks and persecution. In the midst of these allegations, Hawaii’s bid for statehood was being challenged by powerful voices in Washington who claimed that admitting Hawaii to the union would be tantamount to giving the Kremlin two votes in the U.S. Senate, while Jim Crow advocates worried that Hawaii’s representatives would be enthusiastic supporters of pro–civil rights legislation.Hawaii’s extensive social welfare system and the continuing power of unions to shape the state politically are a direct result of those troubled times. Based on exhaustive archival research in Hawaii, California, Washington, and elsewhere, Gerald Horne’s gripping story of Hawaii workers’ struggle to unionize reads like a suspense novel as it details for the first time how radicalism and racism helped shape Hawaii in the twentieth century.",$13.34,

Daniel Goleman's brilliant report from the frontiers of psychology and neuroscience offers startling new insight into our “two minds”—the rational and the emotional—and how they together shape our destiny. Through vivid examples, Goleman delineates the five crucial skills of emotional intelligence, and shows how they determine our success in relationships, work, and even our physical well-being.

People watched helplessly as their life savings disappeared and their loved ones starved. Germany’s finances descended into chaos, with severe social unrest in its wake.Money may no longer be physically printed and distributed in the voluminous quantities of 1923. However, “quantitative easing,” that modern euphemism for surreptitious deficit financing in an electronic era, can no less become an assault on monetary discipline. Whatever the reason for a country’s deficit—necessity or profligacy, unwillingness to tax or blindness to expenditure—it is beguiling to suppose that if the day of reckoning is postponed economic recovery will come in time to prevent higher unemployment or deeper recession. What if it does not? Germany in 1923 provides a vivid, compelling, sobering moral tale.",$15.99,4.2

Uncovering compelling new evidence, Egyptologist Robert Bauval and astrophysicist Thomas Brophy present the anthropological, climatological, archaeological, geological, and genetic research supporting this hugely debated theory of the black African origin of Egyptian civilization.  Building upon extensive studies from the past four decades and their own archaeoastronomical and hieroglyphic research, the authors show how the early black culture known as the Cattle People not only domesticated cattle but also had a sophisticated grasp of astronomy; created plentiful rock art at Gilf Kebir and Gebel Uwainat; had trade routes to the Mediterranean coast, central Africa, and the Sinai; held spiritual and occult ceremonies; and constructed a stone calendar circle and megaliths at the ceremonial site of Nabta Playa reminiscent of Stonehenge, yet much older. Revealing these “Star People” as the true founders of ancient Egyptian civilization, this book completely rewrites the history of world civilization, placing black Africa back in its rightful place at the center of mankind’s origins.",$19.71,4.1

They shared the bill with the Fab Four on many occasions in their home city and in Hamburg, and their first drummer was none other than Richard Starkey  better known as Ringo Starr  who left the Hurricanes to join the Beatles. The Hurricanes were leading lights of the burgeoning 'Mersey Sound' and a pulsating live act, led by their charismatic front man, Rory Storm. Born Alan Caldwell, Rory was a natural performer who wooed crowds with his stage antics, once even diving from a swimming pool high board halfway through a song. But, despite the band’s huge local following, fame somehow passed them by. Frontman Rory suffered from a crippling stammer and, though unaffected while on stage, it seemed to deter record companies. As their fellow Liverpudlians enjoyed huge international success, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes drifted into obscurity, finally ending in tragedy. Anthony Hogan has painstakingly researched the lives and careers of Rory Storm and The Hurricanes in this fascinating and moving account of one of the great untold rock ’n’ roll stories, featuring over 100 photographs, many unseen before in public.",$20.66,4.9

For the first time in more than twenty years, research has shown that members of both parties hold strongly unfavorable views of their opponents. This is polarization rooted in social identity, and it is growing. The campaign and election of Donald Trump laid bare this fact of the American electorate, its successful rhetoric of “us versus them” tapping into a powerful current of anger and resentment.             With Uncivil Agreement, Lilliana Mason looks at the growing social gulf across racial, religious, and cultural lines, which have recently come to divide neatly between the two major political parties. She argues that group identifications have changed the way we think and feel about ourselves and our opponents. Even when Democrats and Republicans can agree on policy outcomes, they tend to view one other with distrust and to work for party victory over all else. Although the polarizing effects of social divisions have simplified our electoral choices and increased political engagement, they have not been a force that is, on balance, helpful for American democracy. Bringing together theory from political science and social psychology, Uncivil Agreement clearly describes this increasingly “social” type of polarization in American politics and will add much to our understanding of contemporary politics.",$17.52,4.0

(The Washington Post).  Thick glasses, socially awkward, a math whiz with a pocket protector- everyone knows what a nerd is. But where did this stereotype come from? Children aren't born knowing what a ""nerd"" or ""geek"" is, so why do they know by the age of five or six that they don't want to be one? In this revised and updated paperback edition of his thought-provoking book, family psychotherapist and psychology professor David Anderegg reveals how the systematic disparagement of ""nerds"" in our culture is bad for our children and even worse for America. In Nerds, Anderegg examines why science and engineering have become socially poisonous disciplines, why adults wink at the derision of ""nerdy"" kids, and what the cost of this rising tide of anti- intellectualism is to both our children and our nation. Drawing upon education research, psychological theory, and his own interviews with nerdy and non-nerdy kids alike, Anderegg argues that in order to prepare rising generations to compete in the global marketplace, we need to revisit how we think about ""nerds.""",$7.99,3.6

48293,1476756112,book,paperback,Seinfeldia: How a Show About Nothing Changed Everything,Jennifer Keishin Armstrong,Simon & Schuster," The New York Times bestseller about two guys who went out for coffee and dreamed up Seinfeld—“A wildly entertaining must-read not only for Seinfeld fans but for anyone who wants a better understanding of how television series are made” (Booklist, starred review).Comedians Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld never thought anyone would watch their sitcom about a New York comedian sitting around talking to his friends. But against all odds, viewers did watch—first a few and then many, until nine years later nearly forty million Americans were tuning in weekly. Fussy Jerry, neurotic George, eccentric Kramer, and imperious Elaine—people embraced them with love. Seinfeldia, Jennifer Keishin Armstrong’s intimate history is full of gossipy details, show trivia, and insights into how famous episodes came to be. Armstrong celebrates the creators and fans of this American television phenomenon, bringing readers into the writers’ room and into a world of devotees for whom it never stopped being relevant. Seinfeld created a strange new reality, one where years after the show had ended the Soup Nazi still spends his days saying “No soup for you!”, Joe Davola gets questioned every day about his sanity, and Kenny Kramer makes his living giving tours of New York sites from the show. Seinfeldia is an outrageous cultural history. Dwight Garner of The New York Times Book Review wrote: “Armstrong has an eye for detail….Perhaps the highest praise I can give Seinfeldia is that it made me want to buy a loaf of marbled rye and start watching again, from the beginning.”",$10.16,4.2

48295,1101886986,book,paperback,Troublemaker: Surviving Hollywood and Scientology,"Leah Remini, Rebecca Paley",Ballantine Books," #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • An eye-opening, no-holds-barred memoir about life in the Church of Scientology, now with a new afterword by the author—the outspoken actress and star of the A&E docuseries Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath Leah Remini has never been the type to hold her tongue. That willingness to speak her mind, stand her ground, and rattle the occasional cage has enabled this tough-talking girl from Brooklyn to forge an enduring and successful career in Hollywood. But being a troublemaker has come at a cost. That was never more evident than in 2013, when Remini loudly and publicly broke with the Church of Scientology. Now, in this frank, funny, poignant memoir, the former King of Queens star opens up about that experience for the first time, revealing the in-depth details of her painful split with the church and its controversial practices. Indoctrinated into the church as a child while living with her mother and sister in New York, Remini eventually moved to Los Angeles, where her dreams of becoming an actress and advancing Scientology’s causes grew increasingly intertwined. As an adult, she found the success she’d worked so hard for, and with it a prominent place in the hierarchy of celebrity Scientologists alongside people such as Tom Cruise, Scientology’s most high-profile adherent. Remini spent time directly with Cruise and was included among the guests at his 2006 wedding to Katie Holmes. But when she began to raise questions about some of the church’s actions, she found herself a target. In the end, she was declared by the church to be a threat to their organization and therefore a “Suppressive Person,” and as a result, all of her fellow parishioners—including members of her own family—were told to disconnect from her. Forever. Bold, brash, and bravely confessional, Troublemaker chronicles Leah Remini’s remarkable journey toward emotional and spiritual freedom, both for herself and for her family. This is a memoir designed to reveal the hard-won truths of a life lived honestly—from an author unafraid of the consequences.Praise for Troublemaker “An aggressively honest memoir . . . Troublemaker is the most raw and revealing Scientology memoir to date.”—Entertainment Weekly “Leah’s story is a juicy, inside-Hollywood read, but it’s more than that. It’s a moving story about the value of questioning authority and how one woman survived a profound crisis of faith.”—People",$9.82,4.7

Where did they get their information?  Behind The Steel Dossier also reveals: what was said between the FBI-DOJ-CIA on this dossier produced by a Russian Expert who left Russia over 25 years ago. No Bias. No Bull: This book intentionally does not contain articles from the media or quotes from Cable-TV. Instead, it contains under oath statements provided by the only persons-Steele, Simpson, and government officials (CIA*FBI*DOJ)-who knew the answers to Americas questions. No anonymous sources. No politically biased remarks-from either Party.  Behind The Steele Dossier focuses on the Senate Examination of Glenn Simpson-Fusion GPS founder-who hired Steele to research Trump.

In the acclaimed author’s thrilling new novel, Brennan is at the top of her game in a battle of wits against the most monstrous adversary she has ever encountered.   Unexpectedly called in to the Charlotte PD’s Cold Case Unit, Dr. Temperance Brennan wonders why she’s been asked to meet with a homicide cop who’s a long way from his own jurisdiction. The shocking answer: Two child murders, separated by thousands of miles, have one thing in common—the killer. Years ago, Anique Pomerleau kidnapped and murdered a string of girls in Canada, then narrowly eluded capture. It was a devastating defeat for her pursuers, Brennan and police detective Andrew Ryan. Now, as if summoned from their nightmares, Pomerleau has resurfaced in the United States, linked to victims in Vermont and North Carolina. When another child is snatched, the reign of terror promises to continue—unless Brennan can rise to the challenge and make good on her second chance to stop a psychopath.   But Brennan will have to draw her bitter ex-partner out of exile, keep the local police and feds from one another’s throats, and face more than just her own demons as she stalks the deadliest of predators into the darkest depths of madness.   In Bones Never Lie, Kathy Reichs never fails to satisfy readers looking for psychological suspense that’s more than skin-deep.Don’t miss Kathy Reichs’s short story “Swamp Bones” in the back of the book.  “Kathy Reichs writes smart—no, make that brilliant—mysteries that are as realistic as nonfiction and as fast-paced as the best thrillers about Jack Reacher, or Alex Cross.”—James Patterson   “Nobody does forensics thrillers like Kathy Reichs. She’s the real deal.”—David Baldacci   “Kathy Reichs continues to be one of the most distinctive and talented writers in the genre. Her legion of readers worldwide will agree with me when I declare that the more books she writes, the more enthusiastic fans she’ll garner.”—Sandra Brown   “Each book in Kathy Reichs’s fantastic Temperance Brennan series is better than the last. They’re filled with riveting twists and turns—and no matter how many books she writes, I just can’t get enough!”—Lisa Scottoline   “I love Kathy Reichs‎—always scary, always suspenseful, and I always learn something.”—Lee Child“Reichs, a forensic anthropologist, makes her crime novels intriguingly realistic.”—Entertainment Weekly   “Tempe Brennan is the lab lady most likely to dethrone Patricia Cornwell’s Kay Scarpetta.”—USA Today   “Reichs always delivers a pulse-pounding story.”—Publishers Weekly",$3.15,4.5

The children rush around among the adults, then after a while pass out boughs for the adults to hold. The sun shines brightly, though the air hanging between the tree-covered mountain slopes is still icy-cold. Now all gather in a circle, each one holding a bough. Soon the singing begins: a hundred voices raised in stately, full harmonies.    Hallelujah!   Glory to God in the highest heaven   And peace on earth to men of good will. In the music, in the entire scene, the ancient and the modern seem to blend, giving a sense of timelessness. It is as if this could take place anywhere, in any time -- while it is surprising to find it at all.",$12.00,3.9

That achievement was evidently just a warm-up for his virtuoso performance in The Gene: An Intimate History, in which he braids science, history, and memoir into an epic with all the range and biblical thunder of Paradise Lost” (The New York Times). In this biography Mukherjee brings to life the quest to understand human heredity and its surprising influence on our lives, personalities, identities, fates, and choices. “Mukherjee expresses abstract intellectual ideas through emotional stories…[and] swaddles his medical rigor with rhapsodic tenderness, surprising vulnerability, and occasional flashes of pure poetry” (The Washington Post). Throughout, the story of Mukherjee’s own family—with its tragic and bewildering history of mental illness—reminds us of the questions that hang over our ability to translate the science of genetics from the laboratory to the real world. In riveting and dramatic prose, he describes the centuries of research and experimentation—from Aristotle and Pythagoras to Mendel and Darwin, from Boveri and Morgan to Crick, Watson and Franklin, all the way through the revolutionary twenty-first century innovators who mapped the human genome. “A fascinating and often sobering history of how humans came to understand the roles of genes in making us who we are—and what our manipulation of those genes might mean for our future” (Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel), The Gene is the revelatory and magisterial history of a scientific idea coming to life, the most crucial science of our time, intimately explained by a master. “The Gene is a book we all should read” (USA TODAY).",$13.59,4.7

But as this definitive new biography makes clear, Gehrig’s life was more complicated—and, perhaps, even more heroic—than anyone really knew. Drawing on new interviews and more than two hundred pages of previously unpublished letters to and from Gehrig, Luckiest Man gives us an intimate portrait of the man who became an American hero: his life as a shy and awkward youth growing up in New York City, his unlikely friendship with Babe Ruth (a friendship that allegedly ended over rumors that Ruth had had an affair with Gehrig’s wife), and his stellar career with the Yankees, where his consecutive-games streak stood for more than half a century. What was not previously known, however, is that symptoms of Gehrig’s affliction began appearing in 1938, earlier than is commonly acknowledged. Later, aware that he was dying, Gehrig exhibited a perseverance that was truly inspiring; he lived the last two years of his short life with the same grace and dignity with which he gave his now-famous “luckiest man” speech. Meticulously researched and elegantly written, Jonathan Eig’s Luckiest Man shows us one of the greatest baseball players of all time as we’ve never seen him before.",$7.76,4.6

In Revenue Management, Robert G. Cross answers this question with his ground-breaking approach to revitalizing businesses: focusing on the revenue side of the ledger instead of the cost side. The antithesis of slash-and-burn methods that left companies with empty profits and dissatisfied stockholders, Revenue Management overturns conventional thinking on marketing strategies and offers the key to initiating and sustaining growth.Using case studies from a variety of industries, small businesses, and nonprofit organizations, Cross describes no-tech, low-tech, and high-tech methods that managers can use to increase revenue without increasing products or promotions; predict consumer behavior; tap into new markets; and deliver products and services to customers effectively and efficiently. His proven tactics will help any business dramatically improve its bottom line by meeting the challenge of matching supply with demand.",$13.00,3.7

48451,1903436451,book,paperback,Othello (Arden Shakespeare: Third Series),"William Shakespeare, E.A.J. Honigmann",Arden Shakespeare," In a period of ten years, Shakespeare wrote a series of tragedies that established him, by universal consent, in the front rank of the world's dramatists. Critics have praised either Hamlet or King Lear as the greatest of these; Ernst Honigmann, in the most significant edition of the play for a generation, asks: why not Othello? The third of the mature tragedies, it contains, as Honigmann persuasively demonstrates, perhaps the best plot, two of Shakespeare's most original characters, the most powerful scene in any of the plays, and poetry second to none. Honigmann's cogent and closely argued introduction outlines the reasons both for a reluctance to recognize the greatness of Othello and for the case against the play. This edition sheds new light on the text of the play as we have come to know it, and on our knowledge of its early history. Honigmann examines the thematic portrayal of feminism, morality, and otherness. He provides a general character criticism, but delves more deeply into Othello, Iago, Desdemona, and Emilia in individual sections. He discusses the play in performance and the relationship between reading it and seeing it. He also explores topics such as its date, sources, and the conundrum of ""double time"". Appendices cover date, details about and possible explanations for the textual inconsistencies, the principal and minor sources for the play, Edward Pudsey's extracts, and musical settings, reproduced from F.W. Sternfeld's Music in Shakespearean Tragedy. Finally, a reference section provides a list of abbreviations and references, a catalog of Shakespeare’s works and works partly by Shakespeare, and citations for the modern productions mentioned in the text, other collated editions of his work, and other related reading. The Arden Shakespeare has developed a reputation as the pre-eminent critical edition of Shakespeare for its exceptional scholarship, reflected in the thoroughness of each volume. An introduction comprehensively contextualizes the play, chronicling the history and culture that surrounded and influenced Shakespeare at the time of its writing and performance, and closely surveying critical approaches to the work. Detailed appendices address problems like dating and casting, and analyze the differing Quarto and Folio sources. A full commentary by one or more of the play’s foremost contemporary scholars illuminates the text, glossing unfamiliar terms and drawing from an abundance of research and expertise to explain allusions and significant background information. Highly informative and accessible, Arden offers the fullest experience of Shakespeare available to a reader.",,4.4

Amazing.” —Gillian Flynn“Unputdownable.” —Stephen King“A dark, twisty confection.” —Ruth Ware“Absolutely gripping.” —Louise PennyFor readers of Gillian Flynn and Tana French comes one of the decade’s most anticipated debuts, to be published in thirty-six languages around the world and already in development as a major film from Fox: a twisty, powerful Hitchcockian thriller about an agoraphobic woman who believes she witnessed a crime in a neighboring house.It isn’t paranoia if it’s really happening . . . Anna Fox lives alone—a recluse in her New York City home, unable to venture outside. She spends her day drinking wine (maybe too much), watching old movies, recalling happier times . . . and spying on her neighbors.Then the Russells move into the house across the way: a father, mother, their teenaged son. The perfect family. But when Anna, gazing out her window one night, sees something she shouldn’t, her world begins to crumble—and its shocking secrets are laid bare.What is real? What is imagined? Who is in danger? Who is in control? In this diabolically gripping thriller, no one—and nothing—is what it seems.Twisty and powerful, ingenious and moving, The Woman in the Window is a smart, sophisticated novel of psychological suspense that recalls the best of Hitchcock.   ",$15.08,4.3

Mansfield, Delba Winthrop",University Of Chicago Press," Alexis de Tocqueville (1805-59) came to America in 1831 to see what a great republic was like. What struck him most was the country's equality of conditions, its democracy. The book he wrote on his return to France, Democracy in America, is both the best ever written on democracy and the best ever written on America. It remains the most often quoted book about the United States, not only because it has something to interest and please everyone, but also because it has something to teach everyone. When it was published in 2000, Harvey Mansfield and Delba Winthrop's new translation of Democracy in America—only the third since the original two-volume work was published in 1835 and 1840—was lauded in all quarters as the finest and most definitive edition of Tocqueville's classic thus far. Mansfield and Winthrop have restored the nuances of Tocqueville's language, with the expressed goal ""to convey Tocqueville's thought as he held it rather than to restate it in comparable terms of today."" The result is a translation with minimal interpretation, but with impeccable annotations of unfamiliar references and a masterful introduction placing the work and its author in the broader contexts of political philosophy and statesmanship. ",$14.12,4.5

These black panthers have left a trail of dead livestock and confused witnesses in their wake. These are animals that are not supposed to exist; animals that are not recognized by science. Despite the reluctance of wildlife officials to accept the reality of these cryptid cats, anomalous tracks continue to appear, pets and farm animals continue to disappear, and sightings continue to be reported.In this full-color book with dozens of illustrations, author Michael Mayes examines historical sightings, interviews contemporary witnesses and big cat experts, sorts through a host of intriguing photographs, and takes a close look at the potential suspects in one of America’s most enduring unsolved mysteries. What are the shadow cats that haunt the woods, bottomlands, and waterways of our country?

The only challenge in her life comes in the form of sexy businessman Vaughn Tremaine. She thinks the ex-New Yorker acts superior and that he considers her a small-town nobody. But when Bailey’s blindsided by a betrayal, she’s shocked to discover Vaughn is actually a decent guy.    Vaughn admires Bailey’s free spirit, independence, and loyalty. As his passion for her has grown, his antagonism toward her has only worsened. Every little thing Bailey does seduces him. But when Vaughn’s painful emotional past makes him walk away in fear he will hurt her, it opens an old wound in Bailey, and she uncharacteristically retreats.   Once Vaughn begins to realize he’s made the biggest mistake of his life, he has no choice but to fight like he’s never fought before to convince Bailey that the love they’ve found together only comes around once in a lifetime….",$10.20,4.4

But for Faye, it meant her sister would have to die. When Faye sneaks into the Mother Duchess's manor, she just wanted to see her sister one last time. Instead, Faye finds a manor in chaos, a murdered man, and an Unending assassin named Aris who needs a new body—Faye’s body—to bring the Bastion to its knees. Now Faye's harboring the Bastion's most wanted criminal. And if she wants to live, she'll have to escape the Duchess and her immortals, all while keeping Aris from harming anyone else. There's just one problem—Aris is not the villain. And now Faye is the only one who can help her stop the Duchess before anyone else—and especially Faye—has to die for the Unendings' whims.",$12.99,4.6

But he persisted in his first-hand UFO investigations in the US, Europe, and South America, and here strips from the historical record the secrecy behind which research into the paranormal was being conducted.",$22.95,5.0

Young people with bipolar disorder and adults who grew up with the condition speak out to share how they experienced the symptoms of this illness during their youth, and how it affected their functioning in school, at home and with friends. Their insightful comments, woven together by the author, form a stunning picture of the young person's internal experience. The reader will come away with a new understanding of these young people and a renewed commitment to make a difference by reaching out to help. ""Tracy Anglada has broken new ground with Intense Minds. While most books speak about the children and their feelings, hers is the first to capture the children articulating what they truly feel themselves: their impossible levels of frustration and irritability, their episodes of emptiness or manic energy, their severe difficulties in the academic environment, and their dread of night time due to their propensity to suffer horrific images and scenarios while sleeping. ""One comes away with such admiration for these children and adolescents for soldiering on despite these terrible burdens, and for the author who took the time to listen and put their words to paper. Parents, clinicians and educators must read this first-of-its-kind book."" Demitri F. Papolos, M.D. and Janice Papolos Authors of The Bipolar Child",$15.95,4.5

48876,1891640542,book,paperback,Famous Japanese Swordsmen: The Period of Unification,William de Lange,Floating World Editions," This third and final volume of the Famous Japanese Swordsmen trilogy presents more thrilling narrative based on solid sword history. The Period of Unification was one of the great turning points in Japan's medieval era. After more than two centuries of civil strife Japan finally found its way back to peace and order under three successive rulers: Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu. The final drive came in the fall of 1600, when Japan's eastern and western warlords faced each other in the Battle of Sekigahara. It was a decisive battle, in which each and every man who called himself a warrior faced the stark choice between the forces of division and those of unification. Two such men were Ono Jirôemon Tadaaki and Yagyû Tajima no Kami Munenori. Tadaaki, a swordsman from the Kanto, had lost his family and home to become a ronin, a masterless samurai, forced to lead the life of a wanderer. Munenori hailed from the Home Provinces. His clan had first lost its castle, then its lands, until finally they were thrown upon the mercy of a local temple. Having lost everything, both men staked their lives and futures on the victory of the eastern forces. Their story, told against the greater historical backdrop of ruthless political intrigue and vast military campaigns, is a story of the tragedy of civil war experienced at the personal level--it is a story of loyalty, of betrayal, of seemingly insurmountable setbacks. Their courage in the face of overwhelming odds still stands as moving testimony to a the kind of perseverance and dedication that can have no equal in times of peace.",$17.16,4.0

Not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Originally published in 1926, Kondratieff's theory claims that the period of the wave ranges from forty to sixty years, and that the cycles consist of alternating intervals of high growth with slower growth. Unlike the short-term business cycle, the long wave of this theory is not accepted by current mainstream economics. In 1939, Joseph Schumpeter suggested naming the cycles ""Kondratieff waves"" in his honor and the term has stuck. The theory has had more influence with critics of the modern economic system than with its defenders, but remains relevant to this day.",$5.95,2.7

How could you run, how could you fight, when doing so would hurt that beloved one? If your life was all you had to give, how could you not give it? If it was someone you truly loved? To be irrevocably in love with a vampire is both fantasy and nightmare woven into a dangerously heightened reality for Bella Swan. Pulled in one direction by her intense passion for Edward Cullen, and in another by her profound connection to werewolf Jacob Black, a tumultuous year of temptation, loss, and strife have led her to the ultimate turning point. Her imminent choice to either join the dark but seductive world of immortals or to pursue a fully human life has become the thread from which the fates of two tribes hangs.Now that Bella has made her decision, a startling chain of unprecedented events is about to unfold with potentially devastating, and unfathomable, consequences. Just when the frayed strands of Bella's life-first discovered in Twilight, then scattered and torn in New Moon and Eclipse-seem ready to heal and knit together, could they be destroyed... forever?The astonishing, breathlessly anticipated conclusion to the Twilight Saga, Breaking Dawn illuminates the secrets and mysteries of this spellbinding romantic epic that has entranced millions.",$12.75,4.5

But when the long-awaited wedding day arrives, her drunken groom behaves shamefully. Nevertheless, Abigail tries to honor and respect her husband despite his abuse of her. Meanwhile, Abigail's family has joined David's wandering tribe as he and his people keep traveling to avoid the dangerous Saul. When Nabal suddenly dies, Abigail is free to move on with her life, and thanks to her brother, her new life includes a new husband--David. The dangers of tribal life on the run are serious, but there are other dangers in young Abigail's mind. How can David lead his people effectively when he goes against God? And how can Abigail share David's love with the other wives he insists on marrying? Jill Eileen Smith, bestselling author of Michal, draws on Scripture, historical research, and her imagination as she fills in the blanks to unveil the story of Abigail and David in rich detail and drama. The result is a riveting page-turner that will keep readers looking forward to the next book in this trilogy.",$15.76,4.6

This book tells the story of these tenacious men as they labored on the cusp of a new age, seeing things that no one had ever seen and experiencing conditions no one was sure they could survive.Mostly U.S. Air Force and Navy officers, among them doctors, physicists, meteorologists, engineers, astronomers, and test pilots, they struggled with meager budgets, bureaucratic politics, and one another. It is a thrilling story of tremendous personal sacrifice and great risk for the promise of adventure and the opportunity to uncover a few precious aspects of the universe. Capt. Joseph Kittinger, for example, rode a balloon up to 103,000 feet in an open gondola and then stepped out and freefell to Earth, becoming the only person to break the sound barrier without a vehicle. Lt. Col. David Simons stayed aloft for a full day and night in a primitive pressurized capsule to become one of the first to see the curvature of the planet. In this work, Craig Ryan masterfully captures the drama of their spectacular achievements and those of many of the other space pioneers who made America's stratospheric balloon programs possible.",$18.95,4.8

The grave consequences of resettlement for the people and culture of Newfoundland and Labrador are illuminated in this intimate tale of one family’s experience across two generations. In the fall of 1965, John Lee, a young fisherman, makes a tragic decision that changes the course of his life, pushing him to a self-imposed exile and to the brink of insanity. Twenty years later, John must face the demons of his past when a young woman ventures to the rocky shores of Newfoundland in search of her roots. This work of literary fiction explores themes of love, suffering, survival and redemption through two parallel love stories—love for a woman and love for a province. The reader will come to know Newfoundland and Labrador and all it has to offer in its vast natural beauty, poetic language, close-knit communities, bountiful hospitality, ghost stories, folklore and colourful culture. Saltwater Joys is a mournful and haunting story that will surely captivate and call you home.",$15.33,

In his behind-the-scenes look at the trading floor and the offices of one of the world's top investment firms, Partnoy recounts the macho attitudes and fiercely competitive ploys of his office mates. And he takes us to the annual drunken skeet-shooting competition, FIASCO, where he and his colleagues sharpen the killer instincts they are encouraged to use against their competitiors, their clients, and each other.FIASCO is the first book to take on the derivatves trading industry?the most highly charged and risky sector of the stock market. More importantly, it is a blistering indictment of the largely unregulated market in derivatives and serves as a warning to unwary investors about real fiascos, which have cost billions of dollars.",$15.30,4.3

She married into aristocratic Nozdroviczky family and had two sons. Since there were many Gypsies in Hungary, she became familiar with their folklore and fortune-telling. After reading a book about palmistry, given to her as a gift, she was ""hooked"" on the reading of palms. From that time on, she read many books about palmistry. She later married Ernest DeNagy, a renowned portrait painter who traveled throughout Europe. Under his tutelage, she became an artist of excellence, and her oil paintings are of the highest quality. While in Europe, she became fluent in German, French, and English and read many books on palmistry published in those languages. In 1931, she emigrated to the United States with her husband and children and settled in New York City. In 1952, she graduated from Dr. William G. Benham's New York Institute for Vocational Guidance, which covered the scientific study of human hands. She later moved to McKee City, New Jersey, near Atlantic City where her husband opened an art gallery and art studio. Being one of the world's foremost authorities on Scientific Hand Analysis, she lectured frequently throughout southern New Jersey and read the hands of hundreds of clients. Before her death in 1977, Mrs. DeNagy collected and read one of the world's largest collections of books on palmistry and Scientific Hand Analysis. These numbered over 200 volumes published in Hungarian, German, French, and English. She dedicated most of her adult life decoding and interpreting the lines, symbols, and other features of the hand for the purpose of helping humanity.",$10.00,

Una giornalista che si imbatte in un'altra tragedia risalente ad alcuni anni prima. Qualsiasi collegamento sembra pura speculazione ma poi la sua famiglia viene minacciata. Un breve giallo che specula su avvenimenti storici. La giornalista Laura Schreiner si trova davanti a una decisione dolorosa. Ha fatto troppe domande e ora la vita dei suoi figli è in pericolo. Una catastrofe su cui stranamente, all'apparenza, nessuno vuole fare luce. La giovane e ambiziosa giornalista non lo accetta. Durante le sue ricerche, incontra qualcuno che tenta di convincerla dell'esistenza di un collegamento con un altro dramma irrisolto. Potrebbero essere speculazioni selvagge; eppure i suoi figli sono stati rapiti. Chiunque ci sia dietro, è potente e spietato. Questo breve racconto giallo è un mosaico che si compone di allusioni e supposizioni attorno a fatti realmente accaduti più di trent'anni fa. Questo libro è un'opera di fantasia.

Includes a new introduction and resources section.Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’s On Death and Dying changed the way we talk about the end of life. Before her own death in 2004, she and David Kessler completed On Grief and Grieving, which looks at the way we experience the process of grief. Just as On Death and Dying taught us the five stages of death—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance—On Grief and Grieving applies these stages to the grieving process and weaves together theory, inspiration, and practical advice, including sections on sadness, hauntings, dreams, isolation, and healing.

49159,1979001650,book,paperback,A Citizen Of Nowhere (Salazar) (Volume 1),Seth Lynch,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," Paris. 1930. Salazar is an English detective haunted by his experiences of the Great War, who wiles away the days playing chess and taking on as little work as possible. When the alluring Marie Poncelet hires him to find a missing man he quickly realises it's a case he wishes he'd refused. Finding a missing man isn't anything like finding a man who doesn't want to be found and Gustave Marty has covered his tracks with a smokescreen that will push Salazar beyond the limits of physical endurance and to the edge of insanity. As he's drawn deeper into the shadowy underbelly of the City of Light, Salazar's closed, structured world is blown apart by the arrival of a friend from his pre-war youth, the beautiful Megan Fitzwilliam, whose tenderness and love of life is a stark contrast to the brutal violence that lies within him. When that violence threatens to engulf them both, Salazar must seek redemption or lose the very thing that has finally made his life worth living. PRAISE FOR CITIZEN OF NOWHERE “Salazar is richly cinematic and completely enthralling with a great sense of time and place, as well as a great deal of wry humour.” “Knowing well the parts of France where the story unfolds, I realize that this book has been meticulously researched, and the pictures painted and the setting of the characters are perfectly described and richly amplified. Lynch has created a lead character in Salazar that is up there with the Colombos and the Wallanders of this genre, and I look forward impatiently to the second book, in what I'm sure will be a long-lived series.” “Fans of Highsmith's Ripley or Chandler's Marlow will love this book as much as just about anybody simply looking for an absorbing holiday read.” “A real page turner. Salazar is so much more than a crime novel and a real insight into the minds and lives in those post war Paris years, accompanied by knowledgeable descriptive detail of people and places.” “An enjoyable read that takes you on a trip back to 1930 Paris. Salazar is on a mission to find more than just a man but his new identity in a turbulent time and place.”",$8.95,4.4

It is designed for people from various church traditions, in the early stages of ministerial formation. Preaching is a complex and challenging business requiring a demanding mixture of skills. People listening to a sermon have the right to expect that a person who stands up to preach, can interpret the Bible competently, has a grasp of core Christian beliefs, and believes what they preach. They also expect someone who has the necessary range of communication skills to put the message across in an accessible way. Such a range of expectations presents daunting challenges to the most experienced preacher. Including practical exercises which could be used by individuals or by groups, this book is suitable for introductory courses in preaching or for modules which consider preaching within an overall focus upon leading public worship.",$30.55,

Elizabeth Meyer stumbled upon a career in the midst of planning her own father’s funeral, which she turned into an upbeat party with Rolling Stones music, thousands of dollars worth of her mother’s favorite flowers, and a personalized eulogy. Starting as a receptionist, Meyer quickly found she had a knack for helping people cope with their grief, as well as creating fitting send-offs for some of the city’s most high-powered residents.  Meyer has seen it all: two women who found out their deceased husband (yes, singular) was living a double life, a famous corpse with a missing brain, and funerals that cost more than most weddings. By turns illuminating, emotional, and darkly humorous, Good Mourning is a lesson in how the human heart grieves and grows—whether you’re wearing this season’s couture or drug-store flip-flops.",$10.87,3.7

Reacher takes a stroll through a small Wisconsin town and sees a class ring in a pawn shop window: West Point 2005. A tough year to graduate: Iraq, then Afghanistan. The ring is tiny, for a woman, and it has her initials engraved on the inside. Reacher wonders what unlucky circumstance made her give up something she earned over four hard years. He decides to find out. And find the woman. And return her ring. Why not? So begins a harrowing journey that takes Reacher through the upper Midwest, from a lowlife bar on the sad side of small town to a dirt-blown crossroads in the middle of nowhere, encountering bikers, cops, crooks, muscle, and a missing persons PI who wears a suit and a tie in the Wyoming wilderness. The deeper Reacher digs, and the more he learns, the more dangerous the terrain becomes. Turns out the ring was just a small link in a far darker chain. Powerful forces are guarding a vast criminal enterprise. Some lines should never be crossed. But then, neither should Reacher.Praise for The Midnight Line “Puts Reacher just where we want him.”—The New York Times Book Review“A gem.”—Chicago Tribune “A timely, suspenseful, morally complex thriller, one of the best I’ve read this year . . . Child weaves in a passionately told history of opioids in American life. . . . Child’s outrage over it is only just barely contained.”—The Philadelphia Inquirer   “A perfect example of Lee Child’s talent . . . Lee Child is the master of plotting. . . . This is Child’s most emotional book to date. . . . This is not just a good story; it is a story with a purpose and a message.”—Huffington Post  “I just read the new Jack Reacher novel by Lee Child. . . . It is as good as they always are. I read every single one.”—Malcolm Gladwell",$14.10,4.3

One of his best-known works, it tells the story of a man arrested and prosecuted by a remote, inaccessible authority, with the nature of his crime revealed neither to him nor to the reader. Heavily influenced by Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment and The Brothers Karamazov, Kafka even went so far as to call Dostoevsky a blood relative. Like Kafka's other novels, The Trial was never completed, although it does include a chapter which brings the story to an end. After Kafka's death in 1924 his friend and literary executor Max Brod edited the text for publication by Verlag Die Schmiede. The original manuscript is held at the Museum of Modern Literature, Marbach am Neckar, Germany. The first English language translation, by Willa and Edwin Muir, was published in 1937.

In Four Futures, Frase imagines how this post-capitalist world might look, deploying the tools of both social science and speculative fiction to explore what communism, rentism, socialism and exterminism might actually entail.Could the current rise of real-life robocops usher in a world that resembles Ender’s Game? And sure, communism will bring an end to material scarcities and inequalities of wealth—but there’s no guarantee that social hierarchies, governed by an economy of “likes,” wouldn’t rise to take their place. A whirlwind tour through science fiction, social theory and the new technologies already shaping our lives, Four Futures is a balance sheet of the socialisms we may reach if a resurgent Left is successful, and the barbarisms we may be consigned to if those movements fail.",$11.52,4.2

Don’t let that happen with this book. The ‘tools’ Steve presents in this book work great. We’ve been using them for over a year at EA Canada with dramatic improvements in onboarding time and knowledge transfer. Here's the key: when you find a tool in the book that sounds perfect for your situation, stop reading and actually use the tool at least once before you resume reading.”  —Jerry Bowerman, vice president, chief operating officer, Electronic Arts Canada    FROM BLAH, BLAH TO AHA!  Breakthrough Knowledge Transfer Techniques for Every Professional!   No matter where you work there are people with experience teaching people who need to learn. Everyone is part of this exchange yet few people know how to do it well. Now, there’s a comprehensive how-to manual for effective knowledge transfer:  Teach What You Know .   Steve Trautman introduces simple, practical mentoring techniques he created for engineers at Microsoft, and has proven in many diverse organizations ranging from Nike to Boeing. This is real-world, get-it done advice, organized into a framework you can use no matter what you need to teach. Trautman provides common-sense tools to successfully pass along years or even decades of experiences: easy-to- use checklists, sample training plans, lists of questions, step-by-step procedures, and a start-to finish case study.     Teach What You Know  will help you orient new employees, support transitions to new assignments and promotions, prepare for employee retirements, build teams, roll out new technologies, and even move forward after reorganizations and mergers. You’ll learn how to       Create a plan for the entire knowledge transfer process     Clarify roles for each type of peer mentor in your organization     Set expectations for communication so you can mentor and still get your other work done     Organize what must be learned into manageable chunks     Develop a measurable training plan in less than an hour     Uncover the list of information and support that your apprentices can’t live (or at least learn) without     Explain the mysterious “big picture” to your apprentices     Create one-hour “lesson plans” in five minutes     Give a demonstration that is guaranteed to sink in     Help your apprentices take responsibility for their own learning     Make sure your apprentices have mastered what you’ve taught     Provide feedback that your peers will appreciate hearing  ",$26.41,4.1

Cars that fly by floating on magnetic fields. This is the stuff of science fiction—it’s also daily life in the year 2100.Renowned theoretical physicist Michio Kaku details the developments in computer technology, artificial intelligence, medicine, space travel, and more, that are poised to happen over the next hundred years. He also considers how these inventions will affect the world economy, addressing the key questions: Who will have jobs? Which nations will prosper? Kaku interviews three hundred of the world’s top scientists—working in their labs on astonishing prototypes. He also takes into account the rigorous scientific principles that regulate how quickly, how safely, and how far technologies can advance. In Physics of the Future, Kaku forecasts a century of earthshaking advances in technology that could make even the last centuries’ leaps and bounds seem insignificant.",$13.38,4.4

The beauty of this practical handbook is that you can use it to develop staff, management, and leadership. Martin Klubeck masterfully covers a second mature behavior from Why Organizations Struggle So Hard to Improve So Little (Praeger 2009). After the success of Metrics: How to Improve Key Business Results (Apress 2011), he felt compelled to write this practical, hands-on guide to creating professional development aimed at helping you get better at what you do and your staff get better at what they do. Creating Professional Development Plans is an essential skill for anyone in Human Resources, Training and Development, Management, or Leadership positions. This book takes the reader through a simple process which includes developing a Master Task List, analyzing the tasks for required skill levels, assessing team members’ ability to perform the tasks, and scheduling training to span any identified gaps. Klubeck has simplified the use of this book by breaking apart the concepts and the practicum. Depending on your reading style, you can read the concept first and then follow the practicum. If you like to skip the theory, you can go directly to the ""how to"" portion of the book. And for those who like to mix their learning styles you can read a concept and then go to the matching section in the practicum to try it out. The two major goals of this book are to simplify the concepts and processes for creating a development plan and to provide a useful tool for getting it done.",$27.95,4.8

Seven years ago, Del Hawthorne's father and three of his friends disappeared near the Nahanni River and were presumed dead. When one of the missing men stumbles onto the University grounds, alive but barely recognizable and aging before her eyes, Del is shocked. Especially when the man tells her something inconceivable.

Casey",Amazing Things Press," From the award winning author, Tracy Lane: Aurora Turnleaf has lived her whole life hearing fairy tales of mysterious lands, magical beings, and crystal towers. She thought nothing of them until the day she stumbled upon a magnificent city, deep within the woods, built entirely of see-through crystal. It appeared out of nowhere, in a part of the forest she’s never ventured into before, and suddenly all those stories she heard growing up become much less imaginary. Her guide is Iragos, a light mage, who introduces her to Kayne, a mage in training for a dark wizard named Kronos. Unbeknownst to Aurora, Kayne had just stolen the Ythra Orb from the Hallowed Hall on behalf of his master and hidden it in her pack. Suddenly Aurora is thrust into a life or death journey to help Kayne find the mystical land of Morgis, home to the Oracles who first created the Orb, in hopes that they can secure its safety against Kronos. The path to Morgis will be treacherous enough, but it is what follows the two teens that is more life threatening. For the dark mage’s fierce legion of vicious minions is on their path, with Kronos himself not far behind, and all of them are intent on intercepting Kayne and Aurora at every turn. Meanwhile, Aurora and Kayne must battle both the elements and Kronos’ dark magic to complete their quest. And along the way, the two teens from very different worlds must learn to work together to overcome obstacles, one of them being their mutual attraction.",$9.99,

Only one piece of the Trident of Eden remains -- Isaiah, a rogue Templar agent, has discovered both the faith prong and the fear prong of this powerful relic. Should he possess the devotion prong, there is little that can stop him. For the time being, Owen and his fellow teens have established an uneasy alliance across Assassin and Templar lines in order to stop Isaiah while they still can. Over a thousand years earlier, Styrbjorn the Strong, a Danish warrior, leads the Jomsvikings against the Danish king, Harald Bluetooth. It is on those Viking battlefields that the secrets of the devotion prong lie. It is there that the fate of the world, the truth behind the teens' collective unconsciousness, and their ancestral links to one another lie. History has already been written. The rest is up to Owen, Javier, and the other members of their unlikely alliance. The actions they take will change the world of Assassin's Creed forever.",$9.11,4.6

Real homeland security begins when we arrest, interrogate, jail, or deport known operatives within our own borders . . . One dirty bomb can ruin your whole day.""Illegal immigration: ""I envision an Oil for Illegals program . . . The president should demand one barrel of oil from Mexico for every illegal that sneaks into our country.""Lawsuit abuse: ""Lawyers are like red wine. Everything in moderation.

I believe we can all achieve extraordinary goals in all areas of our lives? If you have a big dream, but think “I can’t – it’s too big, too ambitious, to extreme…” this book is for you. I used to have all those thoughts. Before I ran my first 10km run, no way did I think about a 300-mile foot race, the Yukon Arctic Ultra, in -55 degrees. When I was fixing typewriters for a living, I couldn’t dream of managing a 450 strong European sales force as a senior Director. These were unthinkable goals. UNREALISTIC and UNACHIEVABLE, not even on my radar. 70 miles into the 300 mile Arctic foot race I started to build a picture of why I had managed to achieve so many “impossible” goals. Over the next 5 days, alone in the cold and dark, I developed the 7P Formula for achieving any Big Goal. If you have a Big Goal you always wanted to achieve, or a dream that you want to turn into a Big Goal, the 7P Formula will enable you to achieve it. Please join me on this journey of discovery.",$12.99,

When Kim Barker first arrived in Kabul as a journalist in 2002, she barely owned a passport, spoke only English and had little idea how to do the “Taliban Shuffle” between Afghanistan and Pakistan. No matter—her stories about Islamic militants and shaky reconstruction were soon overshadowed by the bigger news in Iraq. But as she delved deeper into Pakistan and Afghanistan, her love for the hapless countries grew, along with her fear for their future stability. In this darkly comic and unsparing memoir, Barker uses her wry, incisive voice to expose the absurdities and tragedies of the “forgotten war,” finding humor and humanity amid the rubble and heartbreak. ",$12.22,4.1

They found places to settle down—but then, as Occupy was taking over Wall Street and London, the vocal Dale Farm community was evicted from their land. Many did not leave their homes quietly; they put up a legal—and at times physical—fight.Katharine Quarmby, an award-winning journalist who has reported on Gypsies and Travellers in The Economist for the past seven years, takes us into the heat of the battle, following the Sheridan, McCarthy, Burton and Townsley families before and after the eviction, from Dale Farm to Meriden, in the heart of England, and other trouble spots. Based on exclusive access and rich historical research, No Place to Call Home is a deeply moving and stunning narrative of long-sought justice.",$17.16,

Meant to cure her cancer, it kills her. Suicidal, Simon swallows the remainder--only to find he cannot die. Years later, hearing rumors of a Bedlam inmate with regenerative powers like his own, Simon is shocked to discover it's Gaelan. Two centuries later, a modern-day pharmaceutical company unearths diaries describing the torture of Bedlam inmates, and the company's scientists suspect a link between Gaelan and an unnamed inmate. But when Gaelan and Transdiff Genomics geneticist Anne Shawe are powerfully drawn to each other, her family connection to his manuscript leads to a stunning revelation. Will it bring ruin or redemption? ",$11.55,3.8

It wants things ... and you have to give it what it wants ... Seven hundred years ago the Anasazi people built massive cities in what is now the Southwestern United States ... and then they vanished. Stella, an archaeologist specializing in Anasazi culture, and David, a mysterious Navajo boy, are on the run from something terrifying. As they flee up into the snowy mountains of Colorado, they are carjacked by criminals. Caught in a blizzard, they must take refuge in what they believe is an abandoned cabin. It's at this cabin that they will face horrors beyond their imagination.What Reviewers are saying about Ancient Enemy:""Mark Lukens proves to be a master at escalation and evoking empathy for his characters; his settings are so realistic that one has the urge to grab a warm blanket (and then hide under it). Such a relentless tension drives his horror plot that he kept me up until the wee hours wanting to get to the bottom of the supernatural mystery."" - A.M. Stickel: Editor of Black Petals Magazine (blackpetals.net)""With Ancient Enemy, Lukens has shown the world that he can imagine and write with the best ... Mark Lukens will soon be a household name. Superb writing and my interest in Ancient Enemy never flagged for one moment."" - Lee Ashford for Readers' Favorite (readersfavorite.com)""Mesmerizing."" - James Byron Huggins, author of CAIN and HUNTER",$3.95,4.0

I found books about grief, sure. Books written by psychologists on the stages of grief and books that assured me that I would find my answers in prayer. This isn't meant to replace those. Those books are necessary, but in the raw, emotional weeks and months after losing my twins, what I wanted to know more than anything was that I was not crazy."" Christy, a fourth-grade teacher, and her husband, Brian, are raising two adorable children ages 5 and 8 in Wisconsin.  But Christy has two other children--twins--who died shortly after being born at 21 weeks. Christy's captivating memoir about her hopes, her dreams, her loss, her grief, and ultimately, her healing, is a poignantly powerful and brutally honest account of what happens when tragedy hits. We never think it's going to happen to us. We never think it will happen today. But it does, and it happened to Christy. In an effort to find solace, Christy tried Googling, ""What do I do when my baby dies?"" Unfortunately, there just aren't any good resources out there--at least not any that are truly honest, not sugar-coated with clichés. ""Almost a Mother"" is Christy's way of reaching those out to those who have experienced a horrible loss of any kind, of any magnitude, in the hope of building a community of support and love. And, in her words, ""I just wanted to know that I wasn't crazy because I wanted to punch the pregnant lady at Target in the face.""",$15.43,5.0

Mandara,Steam eStuff," Gritting her teeth Jenny grimaced and gave him what he wanted; the lewd sight of her backside jiggling this way and that as he continued to spank it. His hand now felt like sandpaper on the sensitised flesh. How much longer would she have to endure this? The clamps continued to bite into her tender nipples, and as she swayed to and fro she could feel them moving with her, the ache increasing with each passing second... If Jenny thought life was hard under the expert tutelage of Mark, being faced with a stable full of sex-starved pony girls poses several more challenges. For instance, how do you bring eleven young women to orgasm in a timely fashion? But to her surprise, tackling the problem with experimentation and enthusiasm, she finds herself enjoying the experience. When training begins it is anything but enjoyable, however. Harnessed in pony girl tack, her body is encircled with leather, rubber and steel. It nips, chafes and rubs cruelly, especially when she's faced with a morning of naughty games in the exercise yard. In Book Four of Pony Tales Jenny earns herself several punishments, and is subjected to some very thorough sex indoctrination she has to submit to the whims of her groom, trainers and even the stable-hands. Will rescue arrive or will she have to beg to be released, with nothing more than her body as currency?",$7.99,4.7

Since then, thrice yearly, dozens of camera-ready young-and-eligibles have vied for affection (and roses) in front of a devoted audience of millions. In this funny, insightful examination of the world’s favorite romance-factory, Suzannah Showler explores the contradictions that are key to the franchise’s genius, longevity, and power and parses what this means for both modern love and modern America. She argues the show is both gameshow and marriage plot ― an improbable combination of competitive effort and kismet ― and that it’s both relic and prophet, a time-traveler from first-gen reality TV that proved to be a harbinger of Tinder. In the modern media-savvy climate, the show cleverly highlights and resists its own artifice, allowing Bachelor Nation to see through the fakery to feel the romance. Taking on issues of sex, race, contestants-as-villains, the controversial spin-offs, and more, Most Dramatic Ever is both love letter to and deconstruction of the show that brought us real love in the reality TV era.",$11.05,5.0

Pushed outside his comfort zone, Guy tries to follow Karl's example, until he ends up exploring entirely new frontiers, both natural and uncanny.

Then she meets John, a younger man who tells her during their first conversation that he has lived for many years with a rare but manageable cancer. She is swept off her feet in a whirlwind courtship, and within months, made brave by the early death of a friend's husband, she asks him to marry her! What follows is a year-long odyssey of travel and a growing erotic and creative partnershipâ€”until a mysterious bump on John's forehead proves to be one of several tumors in his brain and spine. The nine months that follow are filled with a life-threatening infection, three brain surgeries, radiation, and chemotherapy. Two years and one week after their wedding, John dies at the age of fifty-nine.More than just a love story or a memoir of mourning, Banged-Up Heart comes down solidly on the side of life. It takes you deep inside an ordinary woman, her deeply felt grief butting up against her desire for more than companionship: passion, sexual fulfillment, and self-realization. It bears eloquent witness to the wild trust it takes to fall madly in love and risk profound lossâ€”a second time. Ultimately, it shows that it is possible to dance with a banged-up heart.",$19.95,4.6

When he goes missing, she's plunged into a world of assassins, spies, and criminal masterminds. When Gwendolyn Bloom’s father vanishes, she sets off on a journey she never bargained for. Traveling under a new identity, she uncovers a disturbing truth: to bring her father back alive, she must become every bit as cruel as the men holding him captive. This suspensful debut from Scott Bergstrom features a strong female character and nonstop, cinematic action.Praise for The Cruelty:""Liam Neeson’s 2008 film Taken concerned a spy who engages in mass mayhem while attempting to recover his kidnapped daughter. Bergstrom reverses this plot in his violent, well-crafted first novel. Seventeen-year-old gymnast Gwendolyn Bloom doesn’t learn that her father is a genuine spy?and not merely an overworked State Department employee?until after he is kidnapped by international gangsters, and the CIA makes little attempt to recover him . . . A grim, fast- paced tale."" ―Publishers Weekly""[T]his debut novel is relentlessly paced, full of global sets, slick action...with a grim, ass-kicking antihero."" ―BooklistThe Cruelty is a nominee for the 2018 Edgar Award for best Young Adult book.",$9.94,4.2

In this masterful introduction, Lewis Dartnell explores its latest findings, and explores some of the most fascinating questions in science. What actually is life’? Could it exist on other planets? Could alien cells be based on silicon rather than carbon, or need ammonia instead of water? Introducing some of the most extreme lifeforms on Earth - those thriving in boiling acid or huddled around deep-sea volcanoes - Dartnell takes us on a tour of the universe to reveal how deeply linked we are to our cosmic environment, and shows why the Earth is so uniquely suited for the development of life.",$14.83,4.7

The Daily Gripe is a hilarious collection of articles that gets to the root of the balderdash in all of our lives, masterfully brought to you by the funniest new humorist on the planet. No, really. Have you ever been on a diet plan, hosted a graduation open house, waited in a long line at a fast food restaurant, or had a child return home from college for the summer? If so, this is for you. A word of caution: drinking carbonated beverages while reading this book may result in painful snorting.",,5.0

Here Feynman provides a classic and definitive introduction to QED (namely, quantum electrodynamics), that part of quantum field theory describing the interactions of light with charged particles. Using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned ""Feynman diagrams"" instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman clearly and humorously communicates both the substance and spirit of QED to the layperson. A. Zee's introduction places Feynman’s book and his seminal contribution to QED in historical context and further highlights Feynman’s uniquely appealing and illuminating style.",$17.05,4.5

He's recently moved from a big city to a small town and there's nothing to do. It's hot, he has no friends and the only kid around is his six-year-old brother, Sammy, who can barely throw a basketball as high as the hoop. Cal occupies his time by getting his brother to do almost anything: from collecting ants to doing Calvin's chores. And Sammy is all too eager - as long as it means getting a ""Level"" and moving one step closer to his brother's Eagle status. When Calvin meets Aleta Alvarado, a new girl who shares his love for Goosebumps books and adventure, Sammy is pushed aside. Cal feels guilty but not enough to change. At least not until a diagnosis causes things at home to fall apart and he's left wondering whether Sammy will ever complete his own journey…  From Ant to Eagle.",$9.95,4.7

When a woman claims that she was brutally assaulted in one of its rooms and left for dead by a staff member, the owners know that they have a potential powder keg on their hands. They turn to Veronica to disprove—or prove—the woman's story. The case is a complicated mix of hard facts, mysterious occurrences, and uncooperative witnesses. The hotel refuses to turn over its reservation list and the victim won’t divulge who she was meeting that night.

50411,1944255605,book,paperback,Questioned by Christ: 10 Questions Jesus is Asking You,Brook Stockert,Light Switch Press," Asking questions was central to the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. During the time that He walked among us, Jesus of Nazareth asked over 300 questions. Considering how much dialogue is actually recorded in the gospels, this seems like a lot. In fact, Jesus used questioning so much that sometimes He even preferred answering questions with a question of His own. In context, these questions are directed to the religious leaders of the time, His disciples, and the on-looking crowds. On a much grander scale, Jesus asks these questions as if He is having a one-on-one conversation with you and me thousands of years later. This book is going to help you get face-to-face with the Savior of World. He has asked questions that cut to the heart of our fears, our hopes, and our imaginations. If we are open to Him, He will affectionately guide us to deeper meaning, spiritual fulfillment, lasting joy, and a life that keeps on living long after we are gone. John 10:27 states, “My [Jesus] sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.” The questions have already been asked and the answers await discovery for those who will embark on the journey. Throughout this book you will be met with ten of Christ’s questions. They will act as a mirror into your motives, your wounds, your relationships, and your deepest desires. Keep a bible handy. You’ll be needing it a lot! Sounds exciting right? Are you ready to be questioned by Christ?",$12.99,5.0

This is THE cookbook. The best of the best of their classic Italian recipes . . . Enjoy a simple creamy risotto con latte, accompanied by a cool glass of prosecco. Toss spaghetti alla carbonara with juicy pancetta and fresh parsley. Or serve up a tray-baked chicken, drizzled in squeezed lemon, stuffed with tomatoes and olives. For afters, a treat from northern Italy, baked blackberry and apple strudel. 'Their favourite classic Italian recipes in one place is something not to be missed.' Jamie Oliver ______________ Opened by Rose Gray and Ruth Rogers in 1987, the legendary River Café changed the way we cook, eat and think about Italian food. Over decades, they travelled extensively through Italy, cooking with friends, chefs and wine makers, who shared with them their traditional and regional classic family recipes. This book is Rose and Ruth's personal interpretation of those precious recipes, the pages rich with their experiences and knowledge. A passionate celebration of Italy and its unique culture of food, these 200 inspiring recipes sit side by side with memories of the places, stories of the people, and insights into the regions, seasons, ingredients and techniques. Woven with evocative photography taken in the Italian homes where Rose and Ruth cooked, and in the cities, villages, vineyards, markets and shops they grew to know so well, this is a book you will turn to time and time again, for special occasions, everyday meals, or simply to read and relish. 'It's hard to decide . . . Rose and Ruthie's outstanding restaurant, or their wonderful and inspiring cookbooks. If pushed, I would plump for the latter.' Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall",$27.98,4.7

In separate investigations that spanned years and coasts, Falco risked his life, suffering a fractured neck and a severely torn shoulder, working deep under cover to bring violent sociopaths to justice. His dedication was profound; Falco spent almost three years infiltrating the Vagos gang and rose to second in command of the Victorville, California chapter. He even served time in San Bernardino's Murder Unit and endured solitary confinement to protect his cover and the investigations. Falco recorded confessions of gangland-style killings and nearly became a target himself before he sought refuge in the Witness Protection Program. But discontent to remain on the sidelines and motivated by a strong sense of duty, Falco eventually left the Program and volunteer his talents again to infiltrate the Mongols and Outlaws, rising in rank to Vice President of the Petersburg, Virginia Outlaws chapter.His efforts culminated in sixty two arrests of members for various crimes, including assault and murder. Executing one of this country's most successful RICO prosecutions and effectively crippling the criminal enterprise, Falco's engrossing narrative of the dangers of the biker underworld harkens back to Hunter S. Thompson's classic Hell's Angels, vividly recounting a life undercover.",$14.28,3.9

A failed salesman turned local reporter, he wanted to test himself, see how he might respond to pressure and danger. He signed up for emergency medical training and became, at age twenty-six, a newly minted EMT running calls in the worst sections of Atlanta. His life entered a different realm—one of blood, violence, and amazing grace.  Thoroughly intimidated at first and frequently terrified, he experienced on a nightly basis the adrenaline rush of walking into chaos. But in his downtime, Kevin reflected on how people’s facades drop away when catastrophe strikes. As his hours on the job piled up, he realized he was beginning to see into the truth of things. There is no pretense five beats into a chest compression, or in an alley next to a crack den, or on a dimly lit highway where cars have collided. Eventually, what had at first seemed impossible happened: Kevin acquired mastery. And in the process he was able to discern the professional differences between his freewheeling peers, what marked each—as he termed them—as “a tourist,” “true believer,” or “killer.”  Combining indelible scenes that remind us of life’s fragile beauty with laugh-out-loud moments that keep us smiling through the worst, A Thousand Naked Strangers is an absorbing read about one man’s journey of self-discovery—a trip that also teaches us about ourselves.",$14.98,4.6

Do you feel like you work hard, follow all the “rules”, do everything you are “supposed” to do, but what you want still passes you by? Do you crave a better job, a healthier body, or a more satisfying personal life? All of the above? Then this book is for you. I’ve spent the past several years studying the lucky and creating a lucky life. What I’ve discovered is that you can create your own lucky charms, regardless of your current living conditions, bank account balance, or weight. There is no magic wand. But there is a proven and simple delicious formula that makes you your own genie. My philosophy is simple: If you can crave it, you can create it. And in seven short chapters, I’ll show you how. Are some of us born lucky? Is luck only for the chosen few? Luck is where consistency of a good attitude, diligent work and clear vision collide. It is clarity in belief, action, and the overall vision for your life. Susan has helped hundreds of clients create mindsets and their own brand of luck. Now, she shares her step-by-step program and easy exercises to help you “get your lucky on,” too. In Create Your Own Luck, Susan uses her sassy, down-to-earth wisdom and real-life anecdotes to illustrate how to take charge of your own luck: Clarity – Are you weighed down by thoughts, excuses, and distractions? Are you ready to get clear about what you want? Passion – Do you honor your core desires? Are you ready to start paying attention to the fire in your belly and the yearnings that tug at you? Energy – Is your energy reserve running on empty? Do you have a way to replenish, nourish and reconnect with your energy source? Leadership – Do you live according to “everyone else’s” expectations and road maps? Are you ready to lead your own life and blaze your own way based on your values, goals and inspirations? Creativity – Do you have a regular creative practice? Are you ready to color outside the lines, reclaim creativity and amp up your luck? Fun – Do you remember the last time you had fun? Are you ready to incorporate fun into every part of your life? Vision – Do you have a vision of the life you want to live? Are you ready to see the future with your spirit, feel it through your body, and design with your senses? Are you ready to get lucky?",$15.19,3.8

She just feels like one sometimes. One of triplets, a quirk of nature left her the odd one out. Odette and Olivia are identical; Clementine is a singleton. Biologically speaking, she came from her own egg. Practically speaking, she never quite left it. Then Clementine’s father—a pediatric neurologist who is an expert on children’s brains, but clueless when it comes to his own daughters—disappears, and his choices, both past and present, force the family dynamics to change at last. As the three sisters struggle to make sense of it, their mother must emerge from the greenhouse and leave the flowers that have long been the focus of her warmth and nurturing. For Clementine, the next step means retracing the winding route that led her to this very moment: to understand her father’s betrayal, the tragedy of her first lost love, her family’s divisions, and her best friend Eli’s sudden romantic interest. Most of all, she may finally have found the voice with which to share the inside story of being the odd sister out...",$19.99,3.7

This makes it uniquely suitable for writing low-level networking applications.This book is divided into three main parts that will take you on an exciting journey of building a fully functional web server. The book starts with a solid introduction to Rust and essential networking concepts. This will lay a foundation for, and set the tone of, the entire book. In the second part, we will take an in-depth look at using Rust for networking software.

Adoptive parents, if still alive, should not feel threatened by this desire; it is a testament that they have raised a well-rounded child. In He Waited for Me, Patricia Kamradt encourages all adoptees to seek out their history because it is a part of who they are. They may find more than they had ever hoped to find. Many, if not most, adoptees search for their biological mothers first. This is understandable because of the maternal bond. In some cases, this search leads to a dead end for one reason or another. In the beginning, when the author was asked if she wanted to find her biological father, she was reluctant. This was because she was deeply hurt by her mother's decision to not allow contact with her, even though she tried to rationalize her thinking. She decided to go ahead with the search for her biological father-one of the best decisions she feels she has ever made. He Waited for Me tells the story of her search and its results, presenting an inspiring story of hope and joy.",$12.95,

A year after her Uncle Bobby mysteriously disappears in the turquoise waters surrounding the Bahamas, Shannon Payne joins her grieving aunt to trace Bobby’s last voyage. Shannon hopes the serenity of the sea might help her recover from a devastating breakup with her fiancé.  Sailing the 38-foot catamaran, A Dog's Cat, is Captain Jake Hunter, a disillusioned cop who has sworn off women. While Shannon tries to resist her growing attraction to the rugged captain, she uncovers dark truths about her uncle's death that might send them all to the depths.  Editorial reviews:  “Look the Other Way is an entertaining beach read that will have you hankering for strong winds, clear skies, and cool tropical drinks. Stanley’s personal experience sailing in the Caribbean shines through in this suspenseful island romp. Readers will enjoy her lushly imagined settings as Stanley expertly navigates the plot mechanisms of both romance and mystery, keeping her story on a steady course for adventure.” —Elle Wild, 2017 Arthur Ellis Award Winner “Best First Novel” for Strange Things Done  “Past secrets make for deadly stowaways when amateur sleuth, Shannon Payne, cruises her way into the Bahamas, navigating the murky waters of lies and betrayal. Bestselling author, Kristina Stanley, delivers an intriguing mystery, with psychological undercurrents, family conflicts, and a big splash of romance. Look the Other Way—you won’t be able to put this page-turner down.” —Roxy Boroughs, romance author  “Be Prepared! Fair Warning: Be sure to make dinner and get lots of rest before starting to read Look the Other Way. You will not want to put this gem down until the very surprising and very satisfying end. This wonderfully told double-murder mystery by award-winning novelist Kristina Stanley will sneak up on you and refuse to let go until you have followed the twists and turns in the unpredictable adventures of Jake and Shannon to the logical outcome...but is it, and are they, and do they, and did they? You may never know unless you take the time and...Look the Other Way.” —James Osborne, bestselling author of The Ultimate Threat  “When Kristina Stanley takes you sailing, hold on tight. Look the Other Way whips up a storm of suspicion and intrigue in deceptively tranquil Bahamian waters. Stanley writes characters who will capture your heart, fire your anger, make you doubt, and keep you wondering until the end.” —J.P. McLean, author of The Gift Legacy series",$16.99,4.9

Barton Palmer, Jeremy Blatter, Tom Gunning, Steven Woodward, Johannes von Moltke, Colin Williamson, Sarah Keller, Professor Matthew Solomon, Dominic Lennard, Nathan Holmes, Professor William Brown, Professor William Rothman, Dudley An",Rutgers University Press," Today’s film scholars draw from a dizzying range of theoretical perspectives—they’re just as likely to cite philosopher Gilles Deleuze as they are to quote classic film theorist André Bazin. To students first encountering them, these theoretical lenses for viewing film can seem exhilarating, but also overwhelming.  Thinking in the Dark introduces readers to twenty-one key theorists whose work has made a great impact on film scholarship today, including Rudolf Arnheim, Sergei Eisenstein, Michel Foucault, Siegfried Kracauer, and Judith Butler. Rather than just discussing each theorist’s ideas in the abstract, the book shows how those concepts might be applied when interpreting specific films by including an analysis of both a classic film and a contemporary one. It thus demonstrates how theory can help us better appreciate films from all eras and genres: from Hugo to Vertigo, from City Lights to Sunset Blvd., and from Young Mr. Lincoln to A.I. and Wall-E.   The volume’s contributors are all experts on their chosen theorist’s work and, furthermore, are skilled at explaining that thinker’s key ideas and terms to readers who are not yet familiar with them. Thinking in the Dark is not only a valuable resource for teachers and students of film, it’s also a fun read, one that teaches us all how to view familiar films through new eyes.    Theorists examined in this volume are: Rudolf Arnheim, Béla Balázs, Roland Barthes, André Bazin, Walter Benjamin, Judith Butler, Stanley Cavell, Michel Chion, Gilles Deleuze, Jean Douchet, Sergei Eisenstein, Jean Epstein, Michel Foucault, Siegfried Kracauer, Jacques Lacan, Vachel Lindsay, Christian Metz, Hugo Münsterberg, V.

Showing the influence of a uniquely American form of mysticism known as Transcendentalism, which eschewed the general society and culture of the time, the writing is distinguished by an explosively innovative free verse style and previously unmentionable subject matter. Exalting nature, celebrating the human body, and praising the senses and sexual love, the monumental work was condemned as ""immoral."" Whitman continued evolving Leaves of Grass despite the controversy, growing his influential work decades after its first appearance by adding new poems with each new printing.This edition presents the original twelve poems from Whitman's premier 1855 publication of Leaves of Grass. Included are some of the greatest poems of modern times: ""Song of Myself,"" ""I Sing the Body Electric,"" and ""There Was a Child Went Forth,"" works that continue to upset conventional notions of beauty and originality even today.",$4.00,4.2

In this compact book, world-renowned spiritual teacher Rav DovBer Pinson presents 32 key concepts of Kabbalah and shows their value in opening the gates of perception. From the Introduction: Simply translated, Kabbalah means ""that which is received."" Looking deeper, the word Kabbalah can mean to be open and receptive, to challenge one's own internal navigational system in order to see, hear, and be open to... more. We must be receptive to a teaching to fully absorb it. We turn ourselves into vessels and invite within that which we wish to understand or grasp. In this way, we become receptacles, dispensaries, and a part of the Kabbalah. We become vessels of this tradition by opening the self to a higher reality, and viewing the spirit within the matter. We raise our consciousness to the point where the Divine within all creation is revealed. As we pursue a deeper awareness, we become less ego-centered and more attuned to the deeper significance of our surroundings.",$9.95,4.6

They struggle with their limited human vocabulary and their fractured knowledge of the world. Other obstacles include new alpha dog rivals, old deadly enemies, and a menacing coyote population from the adjacent Arizona desert. In the end, Taser must decide how much he will risk to save his world.    ",$9.95,4.3

Alison wants to be living a fabulous life filled with myriad social engagements. She just also wants to not shower, put on a bra or leave the house. Plus, she dislikes dancing, the Fourth of July and costume parties that involve skimpy attire. Basically, if it’s fun, count her out, which is too bad, since she so desperately wants you to think she’s fun. ""Tropical Attire Encouraged” came to be on her birthday a few years ago, when her husband, Daniel Quantz, presented her with a hand-bound book of her columns from the first year she was syndicated. He worked late at his office to keep it a surprise. At the top of each one, he included a hand-drawn illustration. Daniel told her he made it because he wanted her to know he believed in her and felt she should be published in book form. Also because one year she gave him an over-the-cabinet-door organizer, and he wanted her to really know—like, on a visceral level—just how crappy her gift was in comparison. (He didn’t say this, but it was implied.)",$12.99,4.6

Cain,Cambridge University Press," Why do American political reform efforts so often fail to solve the problems they intend to fix? In this book, Bruce E. Cain argues that the reasons are an unrealistic civic ideal of a fully informed and engaged citizenry and a neglect of basic pluralist principles about political intermediaries. This book traces the tension between populist and pluralist approaches as it plays out in many seemingly distinct reform topics, such as voting administration, campaign finance, excessive partisanship, redistricting, and transparency and voter participation. It explains why political primaries have promoted partisan polarization, why voting rates are declining even as election opportunities increase, and why direct democracy is not really a grassroots tool. Cain offers a reform agenda that attempts to reconcile pluralist ideals with the realities of collective-action problems and resource disparities.",$29.99,4.0

But these two will learn that sabotage is a dish best served naked. A sexy, compulsively readable romantic comedy that dives headlong into the thrill and doubt of modern love, Dating You/Hating You by New York Times bestselling author Christina Lauren is the story of what two high-powered agents will—and won’t—do to get everything they ever wanted.Despite the odds against them from an embarrassing meet-awkward at a mutual friend’s Halloween party, Carter and Evie immediately hit it off. Even the realization that they’re both high-powered agents at competing firms in Hollywood isn’t enough to squash the fire. But when their two agencies merge—causing the pair to vie for the same position—all bets are off. What could have been a beautiful, blossoming romance turns into an all-out war of sabotage. Carter and Evie are both thirtysomething professionals—so why can’t they act like it? Can Carter stop trying to please everyone and see how their mutual boss is really playing the game? Can Evie put aside her competitive nature long enough to figure out what she really wants in life? Can their actor clients just be something close to human? Whether these two Hollywood love/hatebirds get the storybook Hollywood ending, or just a dramedy of epic proportions, you get to enjoy Christina Lauren’s heartfelt, hilarious story of romance in the modern world.",$12.27,3.8
51310,1944781188,book,paperback,Native Moments,Nic Schuck,Waldorf Publishing," In the tradition of other great ex-patriot stories like The Sun Also Rises or All the Pretty Horses, Native Moments is a coming-of-age adventure set among the lush landscape of Costa Rica. After the death of his brother, Sanch Murray leaves for a surf trip as a way to cope and sets out on a quixotic search for an alternative to the American Dream.Set in 1999 Costa Rica, Sanch and his friend Jake Higdon wander the dirt roads of Tamarindo and surrounding areas chasing waves as a way to live out the romantic fantasy lifestyle of traveling surfers. Jake Higdon, six years Sanch's senior, takes on the role of the wise leader and Sanch as his young apprentice. Sanch's adventure leads to encounters with people who share world views he had never considered and could potentially shape his own changing perceptions about life. Through sometimes humorous episodes such as trying his hand as a matador at a road side rodeo or in his not so humorous battle with dysentery, Sanch explores life's beauty and wonder alongside the darker undercurrents of humanity. Along his journey, Sanch befriends a shamanic traveler named Rob, young revolutionaries from Venezuela, numerous expatriates from around the world trying to escape whatever it is that keeps chasing them and a beautiful local girl named Andrea, who Sanch suspects is a prostitute but can't help falling for.

Your Sexually Addicted Partner shatters the stigma and shame that millions of men and women carry when their partners are sexually addicted. They receive little empathy for their pain, which means they suffer alone, often shocked and isolated by the trauma. Barbara Steffens' groundbreaking new research shows that partners are not codependents but post-traumatic stress victims, while Marsha Means' personal experience provides insights, strategies, and critical steps to recognize, deal with, and heal partners of sexually addicted relationships. Firsthand accounts and stories reveal the impact of this addiction on survivors' lives. Chapters end with On a Personal Note” questions and propose new paths that lead from trauma to empowerment, health, and hope. Useful appendices list health and mental health care providers and clergy.",$12.70,4.5

Beau Walker is a man without a field. Teaching at a backwater university after being dismissed from a government project because of his ethical concerns and bureaucratic maneuvers on the part of a one-time friend, Walker is an academic pariah until two soldiers appear one day. His former friend needs Walker's expertise, and the professor--who is haunted by both his empathic abilities and the memory of the one time they failed him--has little choice but to cooperate. In the Russian city of Podol'sk, a project partially based on Walker's work has gone horribly awry, killing thousands and leaving traces of mysteries that threaten humanity's scientific understanding. Discovering what occurred, and how to prevent it from happening again, falls on Walker and his new friends, who are initially perplexed (in a meeting Walker confesses, ""There's something I can't grasp, like trying to grab a slippery ball in a swimming pool. Always just out of reach""). But as secrets and revelations accumulate, the team's combined knowledge and abilities maybe inadequate to stop what's coming. Throughout the investigation, Walker, a complex intellectual, struggles with the duality of his heritage--African-American mother, Mohawk father--as well as the divide between the rigorous scientific experiments in neurophysiology and psycho pharmacology, and the intuitive, imaginative aspects of his psychological and cultural studies. Joshua writes with a sure hand, managing to squeeze in many discussions and esoteric concepts, ranging from mythic structures to neuropsychology to remote viewing, while keeping the dialogue realistic and sharp...The characters react in believable ways, even when the plot developments, which borrow from quantumphysics, anthropology, and psychology, inspire incredulity. In addition, Joshua has crafted an appealing protagonist in Walker. Short-tempered, kind, thoughtful yet impulsive, he is a flawed but ultimately heroic character, and serves as a narrative linchpin throughout this absorbing story. Deft dialogue, crisp plotting, and a likable central figure make this multidisciplinary scientific adventure an exuberant and involving read.5 stars  Lots of action, intriguing concepts, and examinations of belief systems and the greatest opportunity in human history to reshape the world...It's very highly recommended, indeed; especially for thriller and sci-fi readers who have become deluged with too much predictability and who seek cutting-edge action, believable protagonists, and action that is solidly intense throughout--The Midwest Book Review",$9.90,4.5

The meanings are unlocked through a series of easy to follow steps, using a variety of steganographic and cryptographic techniques. The messages decrypted are not the usual esoteric or Freudian interpretations; rather they contain actual, undeniable information encoded into the texts ages ago.

51415,1451688598,book,paperback,Madison's Gift: Five Partnerships That Built America,David O. Stewart,Simon & Schuster," Historian David O. Stewart restores James Madison to his proper place as the most significant Founding Father and framer of the new nation: “A fascinating look at how one unlikely figure managed to help guide…a precarious confederation of reluctant states to a self-governing republic that has prospered for more than two centuries” (Richmond Times-Dispatch).Short, plain, balding, neither soldier nor orator, low on charisma and high on intelligence, James Madison cared more about achieving results than taking the credit. Forming key partnerships with Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, and his wife Dolley, Madison achieved his lifelong goal of a self-governing constitutional republic. It was Madison who led the drive for the Constitutional Convention and pressed for an effective new government as his patron George Washington lent the effort legitimacy; Madison who wrote the Federalist Papers with Alexander Hamilton to secure the Constitution’s ratification; Madison who joined Thomas Jefferson to found the nation’s first political party and move the nation toward broad democratic principles; Madison, with James Monroe, who guided the new nation through its first war in 1812, and who handed the reins of government to the last of the Founders. But it was his final partnership that allowed Madison to escape his natural shyness and reach the greatest heights. Dolley was the woman he married in middle age and who presided over both him and an enlivened White House. This partnership was a love story, a unique one that sustained Madison through his political rise, his presidency, and a fruitful retirement. In Madison’s Gift, David O. Stewart’s “insights are illuminating….He weaves vivid, sometimes poignant details throughout the grand sweep of historical events. He brings early history alive in a way that offers today’s readers perspective” (Christian Science Monitor).",$12.90,4.6

51481,609810111,book,paperback,Sacred Contracts: Awakening Your Divine Potential,Caroline Myss,Harmony," New York Times bestselling author and medical intuitive Caroline Myss has found that when people don’t understand their purpose in life the result can be depression, anxiety, fatigue, and eventually physical illness—in short, a spiritual malaise of epidemic proportions. Myss’s experience of working with people led her to develop an insightful and ingenious process for deciphering your own Sacred Contract—or higher purpose—using a new theory of archetypes that builds on the works of Jung, Plato, and many other contemporary thinkers. Myss examines the lives of the spiritual masters and prophets—Abraham, Jesus, Buddha, and Muhammad—whose archetypal journeys illustrate the four stages of a Sacred Contract and provide clues for discovering your own. Myss explains how you can identify your particular spiritual energies, or archetypes—the gatekeepers of your higher purpose—and use them to help you find out what you are here on earth to learn and whom you are meant to meet. Exploring your Sacred Contract will shine a light on the purpose and meaning of your life. You are meant to do certain tasks, you are meant to have certain relationships. In coming to know your archetypal companions, you also begin to see how to live your life in ways that make the best use of your personal power and lead you to fulfill your greatest—in fact, your divine—potential.Both visionary and practical, Sacred Contracts is a bold, powerful work of spiritual wisdom. Without a doubt, your most intriguing challenge in life is to recognize your spiritual commitments and live them to the fullest.",$12.82,4.4

Allen, Eve Golden",Harvard University Press," Seventy deeply troubled teenagers spend weeks, months, even years on a locked psychiatric ward. They’re not just failing in school, not just using drugs. They are out of control―violent or suicidal, in trouble with the law, unpredictable, and dangerous. Their futures are at risk. Twenty years later, most of them still struggle. But astonishingly, a handful are thriving. They’re off drugs and on the right side of the law. They’ve finished school and hold jobs that matter to them. They have close friends and are responsible, loving parents. What happened? How did some kids stumble out of the woods while others remain lost? Could their strikingly different futures have been predicted back during their teenage struggles? The kids provide the answers in a series of interviews that began during their hospitalizations and ended years later. Even in the early days, the resilient kids had a grasp of how they contributed to their own troubles. They tried to make sense of their experience and they groped toward an understanding of other people’s inner lives. In their own impatient voices, Out of the Woods portrays edgy teenagers developing into thoughtful, responsible adults. Listening in on interviews through the years, narratives that are often poignant, sometimes dramatic, frequently funny, we hear the kids growing into more composed―yet always recognizable―versions of their tough and feisty selves.",$22.37,5.0

This instantly relatable story is told entirely through emails, texts, DMs, and every other form of communication known to man.   The women in the book are stand-ins for annoying friends that we all have. There’s Nicole, who’s always broke and tries to pay for things in Forever21 gift cards. There’s Katie, the self-important budding journalist, who thinks a retweet and a byline are the same thing. And there’s Jen, the DIY suburban bride-to-be. With a perfectly pitched sardonic tone, Hey Ladies! will have you cringing and laughing as you recognize your own friends, and even yourself.",$11.55,4.1

51853,812981480,book,paperback,Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth,Reza Aslan,Random House Trade Paperbacks," #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • “A lucid, intelligent page-turner” (Los Angeles Times) that challenges long-held assumptions about Jesus, from the host of Believer   Two thousand years ago, an itinerant Jewish preacher walked across the Galilee, gathering followers to establish what he called the “Kingdom of God.” The revolutionary movement he launched was so threatening to the established order that he was executed as a state criminal. Within decades after his death, his followers would call him God.   Sifting through centuries of mythmaking, Reza Aslan sheds new light on one of history’s most enigmatic figures by examining Jesus through the lens of the tumultuous era in which he lived. Balancing the Jesus of the Gospels against the historical sources, Aslan describes a man full of conviction and passion, yet rife with contradiction. He explores the reasons the early Christian church preferred to promulgate an image of Jesus as a peaceful spiritual teacher rather than a politically conscious revolutionary. And he grapples with the riddle of how Jesus understood himself, the mystery that is at the heart of all subsequent claims about his divinity.   Zealot yields a fresh perspective on one of the greatest stories ever told even as it affirms the radical and transformative nature of Jesus’ life and mission.   Praise for Zealot   “Riveting . . . Aslan synthesizes Scripture and scholarship to create an original account.”—The New Yorker   “Fascinatingly and convincingly drawn . . . Aslan may come as close as one can to respecting those who revere Jesus as the peace-loving, turn-the-other-cheek, true son of God depicted in modern Christianity, even as he knocks down that image.”—The Seattle Times   “[Aslan’s] literary talent is as essential to the effect of Zealot as are his scholarly and journalistic chops. . . . A vivid, persuasive portrait.”—Salon   “This tough-minded, deeply political book does full justice to the real Jesus, and honors him in the process.”—San Francisco Chronicle   “A special and revealing work, one that believer and skeptic alike will find surprising, engaging, and original.”—Jon Meacham, Pulitzer Prize–winning author of Thomas Jefferson: The Art of Power   “Compulsively readable . . . This superb work is highly recommended.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)",$10.97,4.3

Religious turmoil is rarely far from tipping the scales into hysteria.Elizabeth Cellier, a bold and outspoken midwife, regularly visits Newgate Prison to distribute alms to victims of religious persecution. There she falls in with the charming Captain Willoughby, a debtor, whom she enlists to gather information about crimes against prisoners, so she might involve herself in petitioning the king in their name.""Tis a plot, Madam, of the direst sort.' With these whispered words Willoughby draws Elizabeth unwittingly into the infamous Popish Plot and soon not even the fearful warnings of her husband, Pierre, can loosen her bond with it.This is the incredible true story of one woman ahead of her time and her fight against prejudice and injustice.",$38.26,4.4

RINGSIDE explores the relationship between art and industry from the view of the wrestlers themselves, the creatives they work with, the suits in charge and the fans cheering them all on.But that's just the beginning.The real violence is outside the ring. Collecting issues 1 through 5.Praise for RINGSIDE:""Keating and Barber's RINGSIDE is a realistic peek behind the scenes and into the lives of several characters connected to a glory-seeking world, but their lives are anything but glorious and that's the compelling hook this issue sells so well."" - Comicbookresources.com""RINGSIDE is a realistic drama set in the world just outside the wrestling ring. Keatinge and Barber present a modern-noir comic book that mixes gritty characters, realistic situations and goes to the dark corners of life that people try to avoid. This comic delivers a compelling first issue and the series promises to be a deep and emotional ride. This is definitely worth picking up."" -- Comiclist",$9.57,3.7

Is there a purpose to our pain? Noting that human beings have wrestled with such questions for thousands of years, Phillip Moffitt has found answers for his own life in Buddhist philosophy and meditation. Reflecting on his own journey from Esquire magazine editor-in-chief to Buddhist meditation teacher, Moffitt provides a fresh perspective on the Buddha's ancient wisdom, showing how to move from suffering to new awareness and unanticipated joy.In this deeply spiritual book that is sure to become a Buddhist classic, Moffitt explores the twelve insights that underlie the Buddha's core teaching--the Four Noble Truths--and uses these often neglected ideas to guide readers to a more meaningful relationship to suffering. Moffitt write: ""These twelve insights teach you to dance with both the joy and pain, finding peace in a balanced mind and calm spirit. As the most specific, practical life instructions I have ever encountered, they serve as an invaluable tool for anyone who seeks a life filled with meaning and well-being."" Practicing these twelve insights, as Moffitt suggests, will help readers experience life's difficulties without being filled with stress and anguish, and they will enhance their moments of happiness.With engaging writing and a strong message of self-empowerment, Dancing with Life offers a prescriptive path for finding joy and peace that will appeal to meditation students and readers of ""Dharma Wisdom,"" Moffitt's column in Yoga Journal, as well as anyone searching for a more authentic life.",$9.98,4.6

In the dead of night the U-616 – a Type VIIB U-Boat patrolling the British mainland in the early years of World War II – rescues a solitary survivor from a sunken ship. His story is so outlandish as to be unbelievable: a colossal shark – far too large even to be a Great White – hunting them for days before savaging straight through their hull and sinking them down into the ocean. Captain August Krauser is sceptical of the man’s story, but as the U-616 continues its patrol he is forced to admit that the danger lurking in the water is very real. Something impossibly large and ancient follows the submarine, bringing the two greatest hunters the North Sea has ever seen into an explosive confrontation.",$9.99,4.0

Kidder opens a window into Farmer’s soul, letting the reader peek in and see what truly makes the good doctor tick.”—Nicholas Thomas, USA TodayIn medical school, Paul Farmer found his life’s calling: to cure infectious diseases and to bring the lifesaving tools of modern medicine to those who need them most. Tracy Kidder’s magnificent account shows how one person can make a difference in solving global health problems through a clear-eyed understanding of the interaction of politics, wealth, social systems, and disease. Profound and powerful, Mountains Beyond Mountains takes us from Harvard to Haiti, Peru, Cuba, and Russia as Farmer changes people’s minds through his dedication to the philosophy that “the only real nation is humanity.”Praise for Mountains Beyond Mountains“A true-to-life fairy tale, one that inspires you to believe in happy endings . . . Its stark sense of reality comes as much from the grit between the pages as from the pure gold those pages spin.”—Laura Claridge, Boston Sunday Globe“Stunning . . . Mountains Beyond Mountains will move you, restore your faith in the ability of one person to make a difference in these increasingly maddening, dispiriting times.”—John Wilkens, The San Diego Union-Tribune“Easily the most fascinating, most entertaining and, yes, most inspiring work of nonfiction I’ve read this year.”—Charles Matthews, San Jose Mercury News“It’ll fill you equally with wonder and hope.”—Cathy Burke, People“In this excellent work, Pulitzer Prize-winner Kidder immerses himself in and beautifully explores the rich drama that exists in the life of Dr. Paul Farmer. . . .

In this universally accessible New York Times bestseller named for her wildly popular web series, Issa Rae—“a singular voice with the verve and vivacity of uncorked champagne” (Kirkus Reviews)—waxes humorously on what it’s like to be unabashedly awkward in a world that regards introverts as hapless misfits and black as cool.I’m awkward—and black. Someone once told me those were the two worst things anyone could be. That someone was right. Where do I start? Being an introvert (as well as “funny,” according to the Los Angeles Times) in a world that glorifies cool isn’t easy. But when Issa Rae, the creator of the Shorty Award-winning hit series The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl, is that introvert—whether she’s navigating love, the workplace, friendships, or “rapping”—it sure is entertaining. Now, in this New York Times bestselling debut collection written in her witty and self-deprecating voice, Rae covers everything from cybersexing in the early days of the Internet to deflecting unsolicited comments on weight gain, from navigating the perils of eating out alone and public displays of affection to learning to accept yourself—natural hair and all. The Misadventures of Awkward Black Girl is a book no one—awkward or cool, black, white, or other—will want to miss.",$12.80,4.7

Most significantly it is the one truly captivating story Jane Austen didn't write... or did she? Detailing her own eventful life and those of her colorful and complex connections, 'Lady A~' renders the ultimate and wholly unique 'Cinderella' account of Jane Austen's history as she might have conceived it--from beginning to end. 'The Amiable Cassandra' is a bewitching tale of a gifted author living and working in an entirely fictional Regency mirror-microcosm. Filled with industry, intrigue and willful independence, it takes its heroine, the remarkable and entrancing Miss Cassandra Ashton-Dennis, into a story of passion, perseverance and pain. After encountering the dazzling and worldly John Lascelles, by way of family and friends, Cassandra must engage with the rigors of unerring love, governed by material expectation, and the unequal demands of becoming a celebrated 'feminist' novelist in a world managed by men. And as Cassandra determinedly carves out such singular existence, she must face an unseen formidable foe that becomes her greatest challenge to happiness and fulfillment yet...'The Amiable Cassandra' is a must-read for any Janeite yearning for an original story that poignantly resonates of Austen and her incomparable work. Using the Austen 'formula', this novel blends documented history, elements of Austen's most beloved plots-lots, characters and themes alongside the parallel enigmatic history of 'The Bath Novels of Lady A~', to create an exceptionally thought-provoking Regency drama. Published purposely in advance of the bicentenary of Jane Austen's passing in 1817, 'The Amiable Cassandra' celebrates her remarkable life as only she might have wittily imagined it--for herself--for her allies--and, notably, for her enemies.",$19.99,4.7

52226,465031471,book,paperback,Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin,Timothy Snyder,Basic Books," From the bestselling author of On Tyranny, the definitive history of Hitler's and Stalin's wars against the civilians of Europe in World War TwoAmericans call the Second World War ""The Good War.""But before it even began, America's wartime ally Josef Stalin had killed millions of his own citizens--and kept killing them during and after the war. Before Hitler was finally defeated, he had murdered six million Jews and nearly as many other Europeans. At war's end, both the German and the Soviet killing sites fell behind the iron curtain, leaving the history of mass killing in darkness. Bloodlands is a new kind of European history, presenting the mass murders committed by the Nazi and Stalinist regimes as two aspects of a single history, in the time and place where they occurred: between Germany and Russia, when Hitler and Stalin both held power. Assiduously researched, deeply humane, and utterly definitive, Bloodlands will be required reading for anyone seeking to understand the central tragedy of modern history. Bloodlands won twelve awards including the Emerson Prize in the Humanities, a Literature Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Leipzig Award for European Understanding, and the Hannah Arendt Prize in Political Thought. It has been translated into more than thirty languages, was named to twelve book-of-the-year lists, and was a bestseller in six countries. ",$22.60,4.5

When the paparazzi cameras intrude he proposes they live as man and wife until the fuss dies down. Emma feels like Cinderella, masquerading as his Countess…only behind closed doors, their marriage feels tantalisingly real…Ms Bravo and the BossOn paper, this should have been the perfect arrangement.Elise Bravo needed a job, desperately. And soldier-turned-thriller-writer Jed Walsh burned through (almost literally it turned out) assistants like hellfire through brimstone. Turned out he had some…unusual work habits to go along with his giant talent and ego. He threw knives to relax. He cleaned his guns as he acted out scenes. And more than anything, he hated cats…Enter Elise, crack typist, master plotter, and perfect for the live-in job in every way but one…two if you count Mr. Wiggles, her furry companion. For though Jed had sworn he would never get ""involved"" with a woman who worked for him, it took only a day or two with the perfectly professional, pencil skirt-wearing Bravo beauty to realize that he needed to keep Elise–in his bed, in his house, and in his life.

The past fifty years have witnessed an enormous upsurge in vaccines and immunization in the United States: American children now receive more vaccines than any previous generation, and laws requiring their immunization against a litany of diseases are standard. Yet, while vaccination rates have soared and cases of preventable infections have plummeted, an increasingly vocal cross section of Americans have questioned the safety and necessity of vaccines. In Vaccine Nation, Elena Conis explores this complicated history and its consequences for personal and public health.Vaccine Nation opens in the 1960s, when government scientists―triumphant following successes combating polio and smallpox―considered how the country might deploy new vaccines against what they called the “milder” diseases, including measles, mumps, and rubella. In the years that followed, Conis reveals, vaccines fundamentally changed how medical professionals, policy administrators, and ordinary Americans came to perceive the diseases they were designed to prevent. She brings this history up to the present with an insightful look at the past decade’s controversy over the implementation of the Gardasil vaccine for HPV, which sparked extensive debate because of its focus on adolescent girls and young women. Through this and other examples, Conis demonstrates how the acceptance of vaccines and vaccination policies has been as contingent on political and social concerns as on scientific findings. By setting the complex story of American vaccination within the country’s broader history, Vaccine Nation goes beyond the simple story of the triumph of science over disease and provides a new and perceptive account of the role of politics and social forces in medicine.",$15.17,4.8

Nevermore! Tales of Murder, Mystery and the Macabre is an homage to the great American writer, the incomparable Edgar Allan Poe, and a must-have for every fan of his work.  Compiled by multi-award winning editors, Nancy Kilpatrick and Caro Soles, Nevermore! Tales of Murder, Mystery and the Macabre presents a tantalizing selection of imaginative stories by New York Times best-selling and prize-winning authors Margaret Atwood; Kelley Armstrong; Richard Christian Matheson; Tanith Lee; William F. Nolan; Nancy Holder; Christopher Rice; Chelsea Quinn Yarbro; Michael Jecks; Lisa Morton; J. Madison Davis; Barbara Fradkin, and many others.  The anthology consists of 21 original tales that blend supernatural and mystery elements in unique re-imaginings of Edgar Allan Poe's exquisite stories.  In addition to these amazing stories, we've added two bonus items:  BONUS 1 ""The Opium-Eater"" by David Morrell  Previously unavailable in print, now included here for the first time...... The Opium-Eater by the New York Times best-selling author, David Morrell, recipient of three Bram Stoker awards, finalist for an Edgar and Anthony award, winner of a Nero and Macavity award, and recipient of the Thriller Master award from the International Thriller Writers organization.  BONUS 2 ""Edgar Allan Poe, Genre Crosser"" an essay by Uwe Sommerlad  This essay adds an historical dimension to Nevermore! as it enlightens readers to the fact that Poe's oeuvre went far beyond his fame as a writer of dark fantasy and supernatural tales. This well-researched essay traces the powerful influence of Poe in the literature of other countries as well as in the English speaking world. Poe is the father of the modern mystery story, but Sommerlad shows that Poe's reach extends to realms as diverse as science fiction and romance. Nevermore! is a blend of what Poe imagined, a genre-less world of unique stories and re-envisionings. ",$15.95,4.2

It’s a story about literature, community, and technologyabout what stories are being told, who’s telling them, how, and why.With provocative discussions from both professional and fan writers, on subjects from Star Trek to The X-Files and Buffy the Vampire Slayer to Harry Potter, Twilight, and beyond, Fic sheds light on the widely misunderstood world(s) of fanfictionnot only how fanfiction is transforming the literary landscape, but how it already has.Fic features a foreword by Lev Grossman (author of The Magicians) and interviews with Jonathan Lethem, Doug Wright, Eurydice (Vivien Dean), and Katie Forsythe/wordstrings.Cyndy Aleo (algonquinrt; d0tpark3r)V.

And while the banks of the Thames swarm with life, a body is dragged from its murky waters. In another part of town, where the air seems sweeter, the privileged enjoy a brighter world of complacent wealth and intoxicating celebrity. But as society revels in its pleasures, a darker plot is played out.Yet some are willing to look below the surface to the unsavoury depths. Mrs Harriet Westerman believes passionately in justice. Reclusive anatomist Gabriel Crowther is fascinated by the bones beneath the skin. Invited to seek the true nature of the dead man, they risk censure for an unnatural interest in murder. But when the safety of a nation is at stake, personal reputation must give way to the pursuit of reason and truth.",$10.85,4.5

Schab LCSW,Instant Help," As a teen, it is incredibly important to have self-confidence, especially when you consider societal pressures about appearance and grades. Just growing up is difficult in and of itself, and in the midst of all this life-related stress, you may not be seeing yourself clearly. In fact, you may be magnifying your weaknesses and minimizing―or even ignoring―your true assets.Psychologists believe that low self-esteem is at the root of many emotional problems. When you have healthy self-esteem, you feel good about yourself and see yourself as deserving of the respect of others. When you have low self-esteem, you put little value on your opinions and ideas, and may find yourself fading into the background of life. Without some measure of self-worth, you cannot accomplish your goals.In The Self-Esteem Workbook for Teens, you will learn to develop a healthy, realistic view of yourself that includes honest assessments of your weaknesses and strengths, and you will learn to respect yourself, faults and all. You will also learn the difference between self-esteem and being self-centered, self-absorbed, or selfish. Finally, this book will show you how to distinguish the outer appearance of confidence from the quiet, steady, inner acceptance and humility of true self-esteem.The book also includes practical exercises to help you deal with setbacks and self-doubt, skills for dealing with criticism, and activities that will aid in the development of self-awareness, self-acceptance, and self-worth. With the right amount of self-confidence, you will have the emotional resources you need to reach your goals.",$5.33,4.4

It’s easy to dream about the “perfect” church―a church that sings just the right songs set to just the right music before the pastor preaches just the right sermon to a room filled with just the right mix of people who happen to agree with you on just about everything. Chances are your church doesn’t quite look like that. But what if instead of searching for a church that makes us comfortable, we learned to love our church, even when it’s challenging? What if some of the discomfort that we often experience is actually good for us? This book is a call to embrace the uncomfortable aspects of Christian community, whether that means believing difficult truths, pursuing difficult holiness, or loving difficult people―all for the sake of the gospel, God’s glory, and our joy.",$11.55,4.4

Young women who had left school at 15 worked alongside senior academics and service officers with everyone treated as equals. To quote an American who worked there: ""Their whole structure was one where you might readily find a major working under a lieutenant or a civilian, somewhat younger. Whoever was in charge was the person judged to be more effective at doing it. The result was an extraordinary group of people in an extraordinary organisation.""_x000B__x000B_This book gives a remarkable insight into life at the legendary code-breaking centre at Bletchley Park, where a team of code-breakers helped to win the Second World War by intercepted secret German messages. It reveals how they lived, worked and played, by focusing on the memories of the wide range of people who worked there.TOC: I: Moving Into Bletchley /II: Breaking Enigma /III: Naval Breakthrough /IV: Americans Arrive /V: Bletchley expands /VI: Creating Colossus /VI: Bletchley Inheritance /Suggested Reading /Places to visit /Index",$11.53,4.2

This is the story of two men at the center of it all.,"Robert Ladd, Tim Brennan, Lolita Files",CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," From Gangsta rap to gang wars and everything in between…. Former Compton police officers Tim Brennan and Robert Ladd have seen it all….. And now, they’re telling all….. For twenty years, gang unit detectives Tim Brennan and Robert Ladd patrolled the streets of Compton. They witnessed the birth and rise of gangsta rap with acts they knew personally, such as N.W.A and D.J. Quik; dealt firsthand with the chaos of the L.A. riots, its aftermath, and the gang truce that followed; were involved in the investigations of the murders of hip-hop stars Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., and were major players in an all-out tug-of-war with City Hall that ultimately resulted in the permanent shut-down of the Compton Police Department. Through it all, they developed an intricate knowledge of gangs and the streets and a methodology that has been implemented by local law enforcement agencies across the country. Their compassionate and fair approach to community policing earned them the respect of citizens and gangbangers alike. This story - told with bestselling author Lolita Files, whose research with Brennan and Ladd has spanned over four years - is a firsthand glimpse into a world during an era many have heard about in song and legend, but have rarely had the opportunity to witness at ground level, from the inside out, through the eyes of two men who witnessed and experienced it all.",$14.99,4.5

Her people claim descent from Kahutia Te Rangi, the legendary ""whale rider."" In every generation since Kahutia, a male heir has inherited the title of chief. But now there is no male heir, and the aging chief is desperate to find a successor. Kahu is his only great-grandchild--and Maori tradition has no use for a girl. But when hundreds of whales beach themselves and threaten the future of the Maori tribe, it is Kahu who saves the tribe when she reveals that she has the whale rider's ancient gift of communicating with whales. Now available in simultaneous hardcover and paperback editions. Feature film in theaters in June 2003!",,4.4

They rent their home to an Admiral and his wife. The wife’s brother, Navy Captain Frederick Wentworth, had been engaged to Anne in 1806, and now they meet again, both single and unattached, after no contact in more than seven years. This sets the scene for many humorous encounters as well as a second, well-considered chance at love and marriage for Anne Elliot in her second ""bloom"".",$7.99,4.4

The result is a collection of double images: the moon a ""copper coin with the sheen worn off,"" ""the flag [that] slips down the pole,"" the country where her grandmother was born once called Russia, now Ukraine. As clear in its language as it is rich in argument, there's something for everyone in Travel Notes,  for travelers are exactly what this poet proclaims we are. It's impossible to read this collection without wondering what doubles wait/lurk/reside beneath the skin of our bodies and of our world.--Andrew McFadyen-Ketchum",$14.76,4.8

Step 2: Never smile at him. Step 3: Never agree to anything he suggests. Or better yet, just follow Lenna Davenport's example and give in to temptation, sparking a whole tangle of passion, forbidden romance, mounting secrets and deceit. She meets her prince charming at her father’s company Christmas party. Problem is he happens to be her dad’s new boss. Worse problem is, her dad totally hates him. But what Daddy doesn’t know… Braxton Farris takes over Farris Industries out of family obligation and expects his new employees might resent his youth and inexperience. What he doesn’t anticipate is the level of contempt Tom Davenport carries for him. Nor does he count on falling for Tom’s daughter. When he and Lenna start a secret affair, a disaster of corporate proportions is bound to follow. But to be together, they must decide if the fallout is worth it.",$8.50,4.0

There's the obvious main event, which is the emergence of a new human into the world. But then there's the non-human event that is taking place simultaneously, a crucial event that is not visible to the naked eye, an event that could determine the lifelong health of the baby. This is the seeding of the baby's microbiome, the community of ‘good' bacteria that we carry with us throughout our lives. The seeding of the microbiome, along with other processes including breastfeeding, kickstarts the baby's immune system and helps to protect the infant from disease for its entire lifetime. However, with interventions like use of synthetic oxytocin, antibiotics, C-section and formula feeding, this microbial transfer from the mother to baby is interfered with or bypassed completely. Emerging research shows that bacteria are absolutely vital for human health, and imbalances in the human microbiome significantly contribute to chronic non-transmissible diseases.Drawing on the extensive research they carried out for their documentary film Microbirth, authors Toni Harman and Alex Wakeford reveal a fascinating new view of birth, and how microscopic happenings can have lifelong consequences, both for ourselves, our children – and our species as a whole.",$14.81,5.0

Smith,The University of North Carolina Press," Most histories of the Civil War era portray the struggle over slavery as a conflict that exclusively pitted North against South, free labor against slave labor, and black against white. In Freedom's Frontier, Stacey L. Smith examines the battle over slavery as it unfolded on the multiracial Pacific Coast. Despite its antislavery constitution, California was home to a dizzying array of bound and semibound labor systems: African American slavery, American Indian indenture, Latino and Chinese contract labor, and a brutal sex traffic in bound Indian and Chinese women. Using untapped legislative and court records, Smith reconstructs the lives of California's unfree workers and documents the political and legal struggles over their destiny as the nation moved through the Civil War, emancipation, and Reconstruction. Smith reveals that the state's anti-Chinese movement, forged in its struggle over unfree labor, reached eastward to transform federal Reconstruction policy and national race relations for decades to come. Throughout, she illuminates the startling ways in which the contest over slavery's fate included a western struggle that encompassed diverse labor systems and workers not easily classified as free or slave, black or white.",$29.95,3.6

The Partition of India has sent millions to the roads, instigated riots as uncontrolled as wildfire...and caught up in its wake Captain Cam Fraser, his sister Miriam, and the beautiful Indian Dassah. Cam has never been able to put Dassah from his mind, ever since they played together at the mission as children. But a British officer and the aide to the last viceroy cannot marry a poor Indian woman, can he? For a while, Dassah believes that Cam loves her. But as the impossibility of a future with him becomes clear, what choice does she have but to run? He may hold her heart but she cannot let him break it again. Miriam rails against the separation of the land of her birth, and as British forces prepare to leave India, she struggles. She finds purpose in teaching, in helping...but is Lieutenant Colonel Jack Sunderland her soul mate or a distraction from what God has called her to do?",$14.99,4.6

Burns,Kensington," Mystery bookstore owner Samantha Washington is about to find out it's not so easy to play Monday morning quarterback when it comes to murder. . .    To the town of North Harbor, Michigan, MISU quarterback Dawson Alexander is a local hero. To Samantha Washington, owner of the Market Street Mysteries Bookstore, Dawson is more than a tenant—he’s like an adopted son. But to the police, he is their prime suspect after his ex-girlfriend is found murdered. It’s more than enough real-life drama for Sam to tackle, but her role as a mystery writer also calls. Returning to the English countryside between the wars, she finds Lady Daphne Marsh in quite the quandary. Someone has tried to murder the scandalous American divorcée Wallis Simpson, for whom Edward VIII so recently abdicated his throne. It seems finding a suspect is no small challenge when most of England has a motive . . .   While Sam’s lawyer sister Jenna rushes in to build Dawson's defense, Sam and her lively grandmother, Nana Jo, huddle up to solve the mystery and blow the whistle on the real killer. With the tenacious members of the Sleuthing Senior Book Club eager to come off the sidelines, Sam and her team just might stop a killer from completing another deadly play . . .   Praise for V.M. Burns and The Plot Is Murder   “You’ll love this delightful debut mystery with its charming and wacky cast of characters and a mystery within a mystery just to keep things interesting.” —Victoria Thompson, bestselling author of Murder in Morningside Heights",$10.97,4.4

She was taken by the Beast, a nameless monster, though some call it a god, that has roamed primeval Robbers Wood since before the advent of man. When DCI Arthur Ravyn and DS Leo Stark of the Hammershire Constabulary are called in, the elder villagers shake their heads. The Old Gods keep what they take. Even if they do find the girl's savaged body, they will surely die themselves. What chance do two country coppers have against an elemental force of evil? After all, this is Hammershire County, where change comes slowly, if at all, where the past often intrudes upon the present, and where old things sometimes refuse to die.",$12.95,4.5

Robert Blair Mayne is still regarded as one of the greatest soldiers in the history of military special operations. He was the most decorated British soldier of World War II, receiving four DSOs, the Croix de Guerre, and the Légion d'honneur, and he pioneered tactics used today by the SAS and other special operations units worldwide. Rogue Warrior of the SAS tells the remarkable life story of ""Colonel Paddy,"" whose exceptional physical strength and uniquely swift reflexes made him a fearsome opponent. But his unorthodox rules of war and his resentment of authority would deny him the ultimate accolade of the Victoria Cross. Mayne also had a conflicted personal life, dominated by his mother. He never married and several of his contemporaries felt that his resentment of gays in the military reflected his concerns about his own sexuality. Mayne was undoubtedly a complex character and here the authors have presented a rounded and perceptive portrait of the man. Drawing on personal letters and family papers, declassified SAS files and records, together with the Official SAS Diary compiled in wartime and eyewitness accounts from many who served with him, the picture emerges of a soldier who, although a flawed hero, was unquestionably one of the most distinctive combatants of the campaigns in the Western Desert and Europe.",$14.95,5.0

Soon, she learns that she is the only operative suited for a crucial part of a mission to stop a plan hatched by a former Bulgarian intelligence officer-the Chameleon-to pass nuclear material to a rogue government seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Time is short and the Chameleon is removing anyone and everything threatening his plan. Can Caroline survive his wrath? Can she stop him? James North is a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer, a former consultant to the U.S. Government, political analyst, and university lecturer. He currently lives in Europe.",$2.24,4.7

Weems Jr.,Abingdon Press," The purpose of this book is simple -- to reclaim a vision for church leadership from the great spiritual awakening known as the Wesleyan movement. Yet the way one goes about this work, contends Lovett H. Weems, Jr., is anything but simple. It involves walking a tightrope between continuity and change. The task is neither to repeat the past, nor to ignore it. Rather the need is to locate the genius behind the achievements of the past from which we can learn for our day. It is to choose selectively those themes and emphases of the Wesleyan movement that can best inform the practice of ministry today, and to seek to grow into them. In order to achieve this, Weems identifies such principles of early Wesleyanism as beginning with where people are, focusing on service, and remembering the poor. He then enumerates practices of Wesleyan leadership, such as leading from the center and the edge, living in tension, and making ""connection"" happen. Finally, he names the core passions of the Wesleyan spirit: knowing God, proclaiming Christ, and seeking justice.",$11.83,4.8

This book addresses these issues by proposing an energy self sufficient ethanol plant that utilizes waste banana stock as a feed crop thereby making no additional demands on arable land. The energy return on investment for this plant is also estimated and a financial model is drawn up to determine economic feasibility. In the most profitable scenario, the estimated operational cost of ethanol production is £0.39/liter with profit before taxes of £44,108 for a 460000 liter per year facility. This scenario results in a maximum selling price of £0.45/liter at an IRR of 11% for a 15 year operation. The study focuses on the island of St.Lucia which is a banana producing state in the West Indies and concludes that establishment of an ethanol plant will require government support. The process used is very simple and appropriate for small developing banana producing countries or any large banana farm.",$63.00,

It is the only time this phrase appears in the Bill of Rights. So why aren’t more people listening? History has proven that guns are essential to self-defense and liberty—but tragedy is a powerful force and has led many to believe that guns are the enemy, that the Second Amendment is outdated, and that more restrictions or outright bans on firearms will somehow solve everything. They are wrong. In Control, Glenn Beck takes on and debunks the common myths and outright lies that are often used to vilify guns and demean their owners: The Second Amendment is ABOUT MUSKETS...GUN CONTROL WORKS in other countries...40 percent of all guns are sold without BACKGROUND CHECKS...More GUNS MEAN more MURDER...Mass shootings are becoming more common...These awful MASSACRES ARE UNIQUE TO AMERICA...No CIVILIAN needs a “weapon of war” like the AR-15...ARMED GUARDS in schools do nothing, just look at Columbine...Stop FEARMONGERING, no one is talking about TAKING YOUR GUNS AWAY. Backed by hundreds of sources, this handbook gives everyone who cares about the Second Amendment the indisputable facts they need to reclaim the debate, defeat the fear, and take back their natural rights.",$8.65,4.8

Whose symbol of his death, the cross, is probably the most recognized symbol in the world, found on buildings, in jewelry, in art, and in cemeteries around the globe? Who performed miracles and has changed the lives of millions? Was he just a man? Or was he much more?

Jeremy is the only boy left after the school’s brief experiment in co-education. And he needs to get out. His mother—a teacher at the school—won’t let him transfer, so Jeremy takes matters into his own hands: he’s going to get expelled. Together with his best friend Claudia, Jeremy unleashes a series of hilarious pranks in hopes that he’ll get kicked out with minimal damage to his permanent record. But when his stunts start to backfire, Jeremy has to decide how far he’s willing to go and whom he’s willing to knock down to get out the door.",$6.98,4.6

So when things go wrong, he’s at a loss to explain why. How does his soccer team manage to lose to a school with a sixty-game winless streak?  What’s he doing at the movies on a Friday night . . . with GINA? And why, oh why is one of his classmates (hint:  she’s Nate’s dream girl) suddenly moving 3,000 miles away?  It’s all enough to make a sixth-grade superstar feel . . . well, not so super. But you can’t keep a good man down, and Nate’s still got pals like Teddy, Francis, and Chad to cheer him up. Sure, their methods aren’t always warm and fuzzy, but Nate doesn’t mind. After all, what’s a little noogie between friends? ",$8.42,4.7

Captain Jacob Brinn, the genius who has challenged the whole world, departs on the voyage for which he'd originally designed the incredible Argo. This is both to decoy the enemy forces into pursuing him, as well as to rediscover humanity's past, and its fate. Meanwhile, the crack team of Argonauts he left behind begin setting up a worldwide network of covert installations. Once completed, these will allow the Captain to hold the entire world hostage. But that is one thing the forces of order in the world will not allow. An uncomprehending world watches in shock as the brutal final battle to the death begins. And so, from the Earth to the surface of the Moon, the future of the human race is spelled out in hellfire itself.",$13.97,

Now, as Jed Wilkes, a New Orleans casino baron, prepares for the grand opening of his greatest endeavor yet—a floating casino on the Mississippi—these primordial river monsters are just waking up. Faced with losing his lifetime dream, Jed must team up with his ex-wife’s new husband, Louisiana’s greatest big-game hunter, to track down and kill off the river monsters before opening night.",,3.3

With no family able to help and no resources, she was involuntarily locked up in the draconian, archaic labyrinth that is the Wyoming Mental Health System. Armed with only a pocket dictionary and any paper she could find to write on, Amy wrote not only as a journal but at times as her only coping mechanism to salvage what was left of a breaking mind in a love/hate relationship with her alter-ego who she'd come to call ""lucille."" Over the course of her first 33 days she kept copious notes of her time there, detailing treatment (or mistreatment) befitting a prisoner rather than the sufferer of a psychological disorder. These diaries roller-coaster between terrifying and hilarious, chronicling from her first morning waking up confused in a disheveled ball gown, living at the mercy of staff who range from inept to cruel and with fellow patients who's light, hope and brilliance are twisted with the daily wrestling of their own debilitating psychotic breaks from reality. What results is an unedited, in-the-moment take-down of what consists of mental health care in this country, as lived from the inside by its weakest links, those it is intended to protect. And for all the dark humor and vivid humanity, she hopes you will be left with the knowledge that since that time, little or nothing in the system has changed.” -DOUG STANHOPE",$12.00,4.9

Holmes,"John Holmes, Laurie Holmes",BearManor Media," Autobiography of the KING of PORN In the world of adult cinema, one name stands out above all others: John Holmes. For nearly 20 years, from 1967 to 1987, Holmes reigned as the undisputed king of X-rated films, having appeared in a record 2,200 plus productions, from the landmark Johnny Wadd movies (one of which became the first adult motion picture to gross over $1 million) to the legendary Insatiable with Marilyn Chambers. To a legion of fans world-wide, he was known as ""Mr. Big."" To industry insiders, he was ""Mr. Nice Guy."" Yet for all of his fame and notoriety, Holmes remained an intensely private person and a mystery man. - that is, until now. In a startlingly frank autobiography, PORN KING was written in large part prior to his death (with new material added by his widow, Laurie). Holmes tells the story of his incredible life. This is not a typical celebrity story, filled with bright lights and glamor, giant sound stages and movie moguls. It is, instead, a rare portrait of a young man drawn into an unknown Hollywood, a secret, forbidden Hollywood, and the parallels between his astounding career and the sexual revolution in American films. Holmes knew his subject better than anyone. Holmes candidly tells of a lucrative but often harrowing ""other"" life as a male prostitute to the rich and famous, a shattering fall into drugs and his side of the grisly Wonderland Murders and his desperate cross-country right afterwards. From start to finish, in this newly revised edition, complete with never-before-seen candid photos of Holmes in his private life, PORN KING is a sizzling, sensuous, fast-paced story laced with controversy. If ever there was an untold story, PORN KING is it. Website address: www.johnholmes.com",$19.95,3.9

After her latest breakup, Lenora “Lenny” Brewer has had it up to the tippy top with her life in the city. Her job as an online gossip writer isn’t what she had planned when she graduated from college with a Journalism degree, and making it to her early thirties without a husband or children wasn’t exactly what she’d planned either. The day after she had to dump her almost-fiance for emptying out her savings account, Lenny goes into work, and her dreadful boss tells her she’s got to write a scathing story about her favorite pop music princess. Well, that’s a step too far. Lenny quits her job, packs her things, and flees the city for her Aunt’s bed and breakfast just outside the Shawnee Forest. When she finds out that the small town where her Aunt lives still has a local paper, and they need an investigative reporter, it’s almost too good to be real.  Add in a hunky park ranger, and Lenny starts to think that Tree’s Hollow is a wish come true. There’s only one thing that could mess up her perfect new home, and that’s a touch of magic. What Lenny doesn’t know is that she’s a dormant witch, and taking control of her life unlocks powers inside of her that she didn’t even know existed. Oh, and there’s the small matter of the murder that occurs shortly after Lenny arrives at the Tree’s Hollow Bed and Breakfast. The death of a local curmudgeon has the town on edge, and the County Sheriff stumped. Will she learn to harness the craft brewing inside of her, or will trouble boil over and destroy everything she comes to love? This book is a cozy mystery with no swearing, violence, or adult content. It is the first book in a new series, and Brewing Love is suitable for all ages. ",$6.99,3.9

The only good thing was seeing Katie and hanging out with her in the creepy cabins of the old boys’ camp. But this summer, Katie seemed different, cuter. Pina didn’t have a clue why. Katie just somehow made her nervous – and excited. Another thing rattling Pina’s nerves were her dreams; well, not exactly sleep dreams, but awake dreams. All fine and good, but they came from her dead Sicilian grandmother, and they told her things, crazy things, love things, like her and Katie falling in love things. They also showed her dead stuff, dead like a long-time dead from the camp dead. So the summer heated up. And so did her feelings for Katie. Things got even hotter when Katie’s dad, Doc, and his very, very close, old camp friend, Joe, started hiding camp secrets about dead stuff – and other stuff. How hot could Pina stand it? If she didn’t want to lose this one chance for a different kind of life, could she solve the murder – and clear Doc’s name? And would Katie have her and would Pina have herself?",$15.48,4.6

Rita chases off the assailants but doesn't escape unscathed, and the boy they attacked isn't out of danger yet. His injuries could last the rest of his life. Rita's heart goes out to him and his grandmother, Amaryllis B. Cubitt, the director of an urban mission that Rita had turned to for help years ago. But the mission has changed from its unassuming past and is now flush with secret donations and gruff guards posted at the doors. Rita can't but wonder if now Amaryllis is too proud to ask for the help she needs. Smart and charming, Rita Farmer is back in the spotlight in The Extra, a second act that is as dazzling and delightful as the first.",$12.99,4.4

At the peak of his career as an eco-architect, Christopher Day developed Motor Neurone (Lou Gehrig's) Disease. Initially, the future seemed bleak, but as the illness progressed, his attitude changed. The more things went wrong, the more hilarious life became. He began to appreciate the gifts illness has brought.   (my) Dying is Fun is for anyone, or anyone who knows anyone, who might one day die. Especially, it's for anyone who needs to laugh. This book transforms disability and dying into a testament for life.   ""This is a unique work. Although suffering from one of the most severe of degenerative diseases, the fire of his creative spirit is very inspiring. His writing, laced with side-splitting humour, is as vivid as ever. So witty, acute in observation, and wise, that I still chortle while remembering scenes read from the first draft three years ago. It is also deeply poignant. A valuable book to share with others - a masterpiece."" Sarida Brown, Cadeceus   ""When my father was diagnosed with Motor Neurone Disease, the devastating effects this terminal illness [has] arrived in our home. However, MND also seems to evoke the best in the human spirit in a positive way... This book is truly inspirational and fundamentally human in its words and spirit. As an observation on dying it is really a lesson in life and I can warmly recommend it."" Lembit Öpik, President, Motor Neurone Disease Association   ""Christopher Day is able to maintain his positive outlook and a sense of humour in the depth of adversity. [He] has transformed the curse of his terminal illness into a spiritual gift. This is truly an inspiring book.""

Bush",PublicAffairs," Every president has had a unique and complicated relationship with the intelligence community. While some have been coolly distant, even adversarial, others have found their intelligence agencies to be among the most valuable instruments of policy and power.Since John F. Kennedy's presidency, this relationship has been distilled into a personalized daily report: a short summary of what the intelligence apparatus considers the most crucial information for the president to know that day about global threats and opportunities. This topsecret document is known as the President's Daily Brief, or, within national security circles, simply the Book.” Presidents have spent anywhere from a few moments (Richard Nixon) to a healthy part of their day (George W. Bush) consumed by its contents; some (Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush) consider it far and away the most important document they saw on a regular basis while commander in chief.The details of most PDBs are highly classified, and will remain so for many years. But the process by which the intelligence community develops and presents the Book is a fascinating look into the operation of power at the highest levels. David Priess, a former intelligence officer and daily briefer, has interviewed every living president and vice president as well as more than one hundred others intimately involved with the production and delivery of the president's book of secrets. He offers an unprecedented window into the decision making of every president from Kennedy to Obama, with many characterrich stories revealed here for the first time.",$11.42,4.2

International development is about technical fixes. At least that is what we, as donors, are constantly told. The result is a highly dysfunctional aid system that mistakes short-term results for long-term transformation and gets attacked across the political spectrum: those on the right claiming we spend too much, those on the left that we don’t spend enough. The reality, as Pablo Yanguas argues in this highly provocative book, is that aid isn’t—or at least shouldn’t be—about levels of spending, nor interventions shackled to vague notions of accountability, ownership, and harmonization. Instead, a different approach is possible, one that acknowledges aid as being about struggle, about taking sides, and about politics. It is an approach that has been quietly applied by innovative development practitioners around the world, providing political coverage for local reformers to open up spaces for change. Drawing on a variety of convention-defying stories from aid practitioners across the world, from Britain to the United States and Sierra Leone to Honduras, Yanguas provides an eye-opening account of what we really mean when we talk about aid.",$10.43,5.0

He has resumed his search for companionship, but has he truly moved on? Will’s mother Katherine — one of the few people, perhaps the only one, who loves him unconditionally — is also in recovery, from a bout with colon cancer that haunts her body and mind with the possibility of relapse. Having experienced heartbreak, and fearful of tragedy, Will must come to terms with the rule of impermanence: to see past lost treasures and unwanted returns, to find hope and solace in the absolute certainty of change. In The Geography of Pluto, Christopher DiRaddo perfectly captures the ebb and flow of life through the insightful, exciting, and often playful story of a young man’s day-to-day struggle with uncertainty.",$21.95,4.6

But with a single confession in the middle of the night, her carefully constructed life comes undone. After escaping a tumultuous childhood and raising a son, she now faces a future without the security of the home and family she has spent decades building. Luis only wants to make the grandmother who raised him proud. As a soldier, he was on his way to being the man she taught him to be until he woke up in Walter Reed Hospital with vague and troubling memories of how he got there. Now he must find a new way to live a life of honor. Every day, young Bashkim looks forward to the quiet order of school and the kind instruction of his third grade teacher. His family relocated to Las Vegas after fleeing political persecution in their homeland. Now their ice cream truck provides just enough extra income to keep them afloat. With his family under constant stress, Bashkim opens his heart to his pen pal, a US soldier. When these lives come together in a single, shocking moment, each character is called upon to rise. “You’ll be thinking about these characters long after you finish this haunting, heart-wrenching, and hopeful book” (Houston Chronicle).",$13.19,4.4

She has nothing but time now, as she recounts the tale of Snow Flower, and asks the gods for forgiveness. In nineteenth-century China, when wives and daughters were foot-bound and lived in almost total seclusion, the women in one remote Hunan county developed their own secret code for communication: nu shu (“women’s writing”). Some girls were paired with laotongs, “old sames,” in emotional matches that lasted throughout their lives. They painted letters on fans, embroidered messages on handkerchiefs, and composed stories, thereby reaching out of their isolation to share their hopes, dreams, and accomplishments. With the arrival of a silk fan on which Snow Flower has composed for Lily a poem of introduction in nu shu, their friendship is sealed and they become “old sames” at the tender age of seven. As the years pass, through famine and rebellion, they reflect upon their arranged marriages, loneliness, and the joys and tragedies of motherhood. The two find solace, developing a bond that keeps their spirits alive. But when a misunderstanding arises, their lifelong friendship suddenly threatens to tear apart. Snow Flower and the Secret Fan is a brilliantly realistic journey back to an era of Chinese history that is as deeply moving as it is sorrowful. With the period detail and deep resonance of Memoirs of a Geisha, this lyrical and emotionally charged novel delves into one of the most mysterious of human relationships: female friendship.",$14.24,4.6

PARTS OF IT SHOCKED ME, AND I AM NOT EASILY SHOCKED.""--Ruth RendellFifteen years ago, Susan Morrow left her first husband, Edward Sheffield, an unpublished writer. Now, she's enduring middle class suburbia as a doctor's wife, when out of the blue she receives a package containing the manuscript of her ex-husband's first novel. He writes asking her to read the book; she was always his best critic, he says.As Susan reads, she is drawn into the fictional life of Tony Hastings, a math professor driving his family to their summer house in Maine. And as we read with her, we too become lost in Sheffield's thriller. As the Hastings' ordinary, civilized lives are disastrously, violently sent off course, Susan is plunged back into the past, forced to confront the darkness that inhabits her, and driven to name the fear that gnaws at her future and will change her life.     TONY AND SUSAN is a dazzling, eerie, riveting novel about fear and regret, blood and revenge, marriage and creativity. It is simply one of a kind.    ",$10.19,3.1

And yet, six years later, she has reemerged as an even more powerful and influential figure, a formidable stateswoman and the presumed front-runner for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, marking one of the great political comebacks in history.   The story of Hillary’s phoenixlike rise is at the heart of HRC, a riveting political biography that journeys into the heart of “Hillaryland” to discover a brilliant strategist at work. Masterfully unfolded by Politico’s Jonathan Allen and The Hill’s Amie Parnes from more than two hundred top-access interviews with Hillary’s intimates, colleagues, supporters, and enemies, HRC portrays a seasoned operator who negotiates political and diplomatic worlds with equal savvy. Loathed by the Obama team in the wake of the primary, Hillary worked to become the president’s greatest ally, their fates intertwined in the work of reestablishing America on the world stage. HRC puts readers in the room with Hillary during the most intense and pivotal moments of this era, as she mulls the president-elect’s offer to join the administration, pulls the strings to build a coalition for his war against Libya, and scrambles to deal with the fallout from the terrible events in Benghazi—all while keeping one eye focused on 2016.  HRC offers a rare look inside the merciless Clinton political machine, as Bill Clinton handled the messy business of avenging Hillary’s primary loss while she tried to remain above the partisan fray. Exploring her friendships and alliances with Robert Gates, David Petraeus, Leon Panetta, Joe Biden, and the president himself, Allen and Parnes show how Hillary fundamentally transformed the State Department through the force of her celebrity and her unparalleled knowledge of how power works in Washington. Filled with deep reporting and immersive storytelling, this remarkable portrait of the most important female politician in American history is an essential inside look at the woman who may be our next president.",$7.54,3.7

Bruhn,"Heritage Books, Inc."," U.S. Navy rescue tugs and salvage ships were in the thick of the action during the invasion of French North Africa, the lengthy, bitter Italian Campaign, and the invasion of France in World War II. Seventeen officers and men from the salvage ship Brant and the fleet tug Cherokee received Navy Cross Medals for their heroic actions during a special operation in French Morocco. Cherokee was the first Atlantic Fleet tug to earn a battle star overseas. Tugs and salvage ships were with the Fleet at Sicily, Salerno, Anzio, Normandy, and during the invasion of southern France. Tugs saved many ships damaged by combat action, and the lives of sailors and soldiers aboard aflame or sinking ships, or in the sea. These workhorses also pulled scores of landing craft off hostile beaches. Thirty-six tugs and six salvage ships collectively garnered sixty-six battle stars. The fleet tugs Arikara and Pinto, and rescue tug ATR-2, received the Navy Unit Commendation for their work off Omaha beach at Normandy. Officers and crewmen who took vessels into harm’s way received awards for valor for acts of heroism performed under fire. Following the capture of enemy ports, tugs and salvage ships and their salvage personnel worked with minesweepers and mine clearance divers to open harbors critical to sea-supplied support of Allied troops ashore.",$33.00,

I thoroughly enjoyed the Paper Magician.” —Brandon Sanderson, author of Mistborn and The Way of Kings Ceony Twill arrives at the cottage of Magician Emery Thane with a broken heart. Having graduated at the top of her class from the Tagis Praff School for the Magically Inclined, Ceony is assigned an apprenticeship in paper magic despite her dreams of bespelling metal. And once she’s bonded to paper, that will be her only magic…forever.Yet the spells Ceony learns under the strange yet kind Thane turn out to be more marvelous than she could have ever imagined—animating paper creatures, bringing stories to life via ghostly images, even reading fortunes. But as she discovers these wonders, Ceony also learns of the extraordinary dangers of forbidden magic.An Excisioner—a practitioner of dark, flesh magic—invades the cottage and rips Thane’s heart from his chest. To save her teacher’s life, Ceony must face the evil magician and embark on an unbelievable adventure that will take her into the chambers of Thane’s still-beating heart—and reveal the very soul of the man.From the imaginative mind of debut author Charlie N. Holmberg, The Paper Magician is an extraordinary adventure both dark and whimsical that will delight readers of all ages.Short-Listed for the 2015 ALA Fantasy Reading List ",$7.48,4.0

Of spending so much time and energy trying to live up to the expectations of others? Of being afraid to show people the real you?   Do you sometimes feel like an impostor in your own life?   So many women today are living the “try hard” life. Trying to be perfect. Trying to maintain control. Trying to be what others want them to be. In her counseling practice Rita Schulte meets women in this place almost daily. In Impostor she combines medical research with moving stories from her own life and practice to help you uncover the lies, distortions, and other contributing factors that set up the imposter self. You will learn:   ·          How five core needs drive our behavior ·          Why we pretend ·          Why we fear being known ·          How to give up the “try hard” life once and for all   Most importantly you’ll discover what it takes to distinguish the impostor’s identity from the one that is intrinsically yours in Christ. Healing will come as you remove the mask and begin the journey of self-discovery.",$14.99,5.0

Her client is Marion ‘Andy’ Hardy, convicted along with his brother Emory of the rape and murder of two women. But Emory received a life sentence while Andy got the death penalty, labeled the ringleader despite his low IQ and Emory’s dominant personality.Convinced that Andy’s previous lawyers missed mitigating evidence that would have kept him off death row, Janet investigates Andy’s past. She discovers a sordid and damaged upbringing, a series of errors on the part of his previous counsel, and most worrying of all, the possibility that there is far more to the murders than was first thought. Andy may be guilty, but does he deserve to die?",$8.80,3.5

But on this warm evening, three children do not return from the dark and silent woods. When the police arrive, they find only one of the children gripping a tree trunk in terror, wearing blood-filled sneakers, and unable to recall a single detail of the previous hours. Twenty years later, the found boy, Rob Ryan, is a detective on the Dublin Murder Squad and keeps his past a secret. But when a twelve-year-old girl is found murdered in the same woods, he and Detective Cassie Maddox—his partner and closest friend—find themselves investigating a case chillingly similar to the previous unsolved mystery. Now, with only snippets of long-buried memories to guide him, Ryan has the chance to uncover both the mystery of the case before him and that of his own shadowy past. Richly atmospheric and stunning in its complexity, In the Woods is utterly convincing and surprising to the end.",$13.93,3.9

With her boyfriend Zac returning to Haiti to visit his family, Lauren is on her own in Ashford, Massachusetts—and danger is never far behind. Still reeling from an attack by her student’s murderer, Lauren decides to brush up on her karate and finds herself drawn to handsome sensei Dan Talbot. During a run near the sea bluffs, she discovers the corpse of her insurance agent, Charles Heard, who is also a Trustee for one of the oldest land trusts in the country. Earlier that day, Lauren had a public argument with Heard over her policy— and is now a suspect in the case. Determined to clear her name, Lauren sets out to discover the real story behind the mismanaged land trust, the dead man’s volatile sister—and a possible link to her own father’s mysterious death more than a decade ago. But a near miss with a car, snippets of strange conversations in French and Farsi, slashed tires, and finding yet another attack victim on the beach make it clear that Lauren is also a target—and the killer is closing in. Can Lauren discover the killer before she becomes the next victim? “Tace Baker has a genuine knack for spinning a deftly crafted mystery that will keep the reader’s total attention from beginning to end.”  —Julie Simmons, The Midwest Book Review “In this page-turner of a mystery, linguistics professor Lauren Rousseau uses her smarts, her Quaker faith, and her summer vacation to bring a vicious murderer—and a secret from her own past—into the light.” —Barbara Ross, Agatha-nominated author, the Maine Clambake Mysteries “Starts with a bang and doesn’t let up. Who knew Quakers could be so exciting! A wonderful addition to the Lauren Rousseau series!” —Philip Gulley, author, Harmony and Hope series, and Living the Quaker Way “No bluffing, you’ll love Lauren Rousseau’s second adventure. This is a smooth read with a lovely setting, appealing characters, lots of satisfying plot tangles, and a deep secret from Lauren’s past to keep you turning these pages.” —Kaye George, author, Cressa Carraway Mysteries and the Fat Cat Mysteries",$12.99,4.5

And, why has traditional selling become impotent, no longer delivering the PRG necessary not only necessary for survival, but for an enterprise to flourish? In other words, how are you and your organization defeating ""sameness,"" the business disease that's reached epidemic proportions? Sean Stormes is the CEO of multiple enterprises, and a national thought leader and keynote speaker on the high-interest, hot topic of demand creation. Answering the aforementioned questions with a proven philosophy and framework, Sean highlights not only the new ""source code"" necessary for PRG in the third millennium, but also the litany of root causes of poor or regressive PRG. Whether sharing the work he has done on the consulting side via his PRG and demand creation firm, The Third Door, or through the organizations he has led or currently leads, Clean Slate is loaded with real world examples, challenges, and most importantly, effective architecture that gives hope to business leadership of all shapes, sizes and industries. Widely regarded as an authority on helping companies become ""organizationally fit,"" where the purpose-driven business wins big, Sean is also a Chief Value Designer, stimulating leadership (and others) to see what others miss, discovering game-changing unprecedented value via the customer's ""unspoken"" needs.",$13.99,5.0

It is a journey full of intimacy, adventure, and beauty?but like any fairy tale it is also fraught with more than a little danger. To ignore this whispered call is to become one of the living dead who carry on their lives divorced from their most intimate selves, their heart. The Sacred Romance calls to us in our fondest memories, our greatest loves, our noblest achievements, even our deepest hurts. The reward is worth the risk. God Himself longs for us, if we are but willing . . .The Sacred Romance strikes a chord in us because more than in any other age, we have lost touch with our hearts. We have left that essential part of ourselves behind in the pursuit of efficiency, success, and even Christian service.If you long for something more, even if you don't know what that something is, then open this profound book. Before long you will find yourself eagerly turning the pages to find out what happens next. The Sacred Romance is the story of our lives; it is God's story. It is His invitation to experience His unfathomable love for us.",$11.00,4.5

This groundbreaking and powerful theory now forms the basis of computer science. In Turing's Vision, Chris Bernhardt explains the theory, Turing's most important contribution, for the general reader. Bernhardt argues that the strength of Turing's theory is its simplicity, and that, explained in a straightforward manner, it is eminently understandable by the nonspecialist. As Marvin Minsky writes, “The sheer simplicity of the theory's foundation and extraordinary short path from this foundation to its logical and surprising conclusions give the theory a mathematical beauty that alone guarantees it a permanent place in computer theory.” Bernhardt begins with the foundation and systematically builds to the surprising conclusions. He also views Turing's theory in the context of mathematical history, other views of computation (including those of Alonzo Church), Turing's later work, and the birth of the modern computer.In the paper, “On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,” Turing thinks carefully about how humans perform computation, breaking it down into a sequence of steps, and then constructs theoretical machines capable of performing each step. Turing wanted to show that there were problems that were beyond any computer's ability to solve; in particular, he wanted to find a decision problem that he could prove was undecidable. To explain Turing's ideas, Bernhardt examines three well-known decision problems to explore the concept of undecidability; investigates theoretical computing machines, including Turing machines; explains universal machines; and proves that certain problems are undecidable, including Turing's problem concerning computable numbers.",$14.49,4.5

Persuasive arguments crafted with tools borrowed from logic, science, and philosophy, as well as scripture, solidify the faith of the Christian reader and provide starting points for discussions with skeptics. With clear, easy-to-follow explanations of key concepts and controversies, God’s Not Dead is apologetics for the twenty-first century, presented in layman’s terms. Readers will be empowered not only to talk about their own faith with confidence but to lead others to a relationship with Jesus.",$11.59,4.5

Is it possible that in one part of the European Administration at least, almost all the citizens are happy with their lot in life? It seems unlikely. When the numbers don't add up at the Athens branch of the Investigation and Interrogation Division, Para-investigator Toreth is sent there from New London to review their procedures. With sunshine, a less-than-urgent assignment, and hosts who seem anxious to ensure that he has a good time, it seems like the perfect chance for a holiday on Administration time. Or it would if he didn't have to leave Sara and the rest of his regular team behind. Working alone for once, as the investigation becomes more complex Toreth finds himself surrounded by people he can't trust. Worse than that, he has to leave Warrick on his own in New London, a situation further complicated by the reappearance of an old adversary. The fifth book in the Administration series contains the novella Quis Custodiet and seven short stories, following the careers of para-investigator and inveterate trouble-magnet Val Toreth and ambitious, if occasionally blinkered, corporate Keir Warrick in the near-future dystopia of the European Administration.",,5.0

It will serve as a source of encouragement to anyone who has failed or thinks they’ve messed up so bad that God can’t use them. God didn’t choose those most likely to succeed; He chose the foolish and the weak—those who wouldn’t be considered wise, mighty, or noble in the flesh. Jesus takes the underdogs and makes Himself shine through them. He’ll take the filthy and make them fishers of men.  Jesus came for the sick, lost, and dying. Read the stories of real people, and the stories of numerous biblical figures who failed and failed again, yet were extravagantly redeemed and restored. It is not a “how to” book, but through the stories and teachings about grace, forgiveness, destiny, and faith, readers will see how to release the past and pursue all God has for them. No matter how great your failure God’s destiny is always greater! ",$11.89,4.7

Providing an intimate window into a loving Muslim home, Qureshi shares how he developed a passion for Islam before discovering, almost against his will, evidence that Jesus rose from the dead and claimed to be God. Unable to deny the arguments but not wanting to deny his family, Qureshi’s inner turmoil will challenge Christians and Muslims alike. Engaging and thought-provoking, Seeking Allah, Finding Jesus tells a powerful story of the clash between Islam and Christianity in one man’s heart—and of the peace he eventually found in Jesus.

In his book Out of the Devil's Caldron: A Journey from Darkness to Light, John Ramirez tells the story of how he was trained to be the third-ranked high priest of a satanic cult in New York City-casting powerful witchcraft spells and controlling entire spiritual regions. But what started as a long spiral into the underworld ended in a miraculous encounter with Jesus Christ that changed the course of his life. Let John Ramirez walk you through the dark alleys of this world as he uncovers the hidden secrets of darkness through his powerful testimony. People from all ethnic backgrounds dabble in the occult and fall victim to this satanic underworld, never seeing the way out. John Ramirez is one in a million who made it out. John Ramirez's home church for the past nine years has been Times Square Church in New York, founded by David Wilkerson. John has been blessed with the opportunity not only to attend there and sit under the Word and mature spiritually, but the Lord opened the door through the security ministry to form a tight bond between him and Pastor Dave. For two and a half years John had the privilege and blessing to walk with Pastor Dave, and he became a spiritual father to John. He prayed with him, laid hands on him, and even read the manuscript of Out of the Devil's Cauldron before the book was published, giving his blessing. Pastor Dave was so touched by John's testimony that one night he brought him up on stage to have him share his story with the congregation. In the 1950s, Pastor Dave had a young Nicky Cruz in his life. When Nicky told Pastor Dave ""I will cut you into a thousand pieces,"" through the Holy Spirit Pastor Dave said, ""Nicky, if you cut me into a thousand pieces, all one thousand pieces would say 'Jesus loves you.'"" Many years later, David Wilkerson through the Holy Spirit said to John Ramirez, ""I see Jesus in you."" And those words forever changed John's life, to go minister anywhere in the world. Today, John Ramirez says, ""Thank you, Pastor Dave, for seeing Jesus in me."" John Ramirez is a sought-out speaker by many who want to hear of his involvement in the highest levels of the occult and how he got out. He speaks at churches, schools, rallies, and conferences--both secular and Christian--and has been a featured guest on TV and radio programs. He can be reached at JohnRamirez.org.",$15.99,4.8

Tory Pace, the heroine of this beautifully written and hilarious black comedy, is all of these things. Typically, she's trying to make the best of life in a difficult time: struggling, as only a mother can, to sustain her family in a land starved of nourishment. But like so many triumphs over adversity, her survival comes with a heavy price. Beginning shortly after the outbreak of war and continuing into the deftly drawn austerity years that followed, Woodward offers a generous family saga. Equally memorable for poignant moments of sadness, comic tableau, witty observations and unforgettable characters, Nourishment is a novel like no other every bit as unique and charming as an English family, in fact.",$8.65,4.4

So Terra goes undercover, disguised as a man, and she joins the quest. What other choice does she have?Once the quest begins, there are many surprises along the way, including an enchanted stone that allows Terra to visit Athene, because neither woman wants to be away from the other’s lips for very long. Back on the quest, a man with flaming horns is hot on Terra’s trail, and he will stop at nothing to end her questand end her life.

White,White Knight Press," This book, a complete guide to the operation and features of the Canon PowerShot S110 digital camera, is a follow-up to the author's earlier guides to advanced compact digital cameras. This guide explains all operations, features, menus, and controls of the PowerShot S110 camera in clear language, providing guidance not only about how to accomplish things with the camera, but when and why to use certain features. The book does not assume any specialized knowledge by the reader, but clearly explains topics such as autofocus, manual focus, depth of field, aperture priority, shutter priority, HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography, white balance, ISO, and macro photography. The book gives details about how to take advantage of the camera's varied array of Scene and Creative Filters shooting settings. The guide's more than 300 photographs, almost all in full color, provide illustrations of the camera's controls and menus, and also include examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the Creative Filters settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing and other aspects of images; various menu options such as i-Contrast and digital zoom; and the camera's strong set of features for continuous shooting. In addition, the book goes beyond the realm of everyday photography, providing introductions to more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, and using the Raw format, which permits a wide range of adjustments to images after they have been captured. The book also includes a full discussion of the video recording abilities of the PowerShot S110, which can record high-definition (HD) video with stereo sound and can take ""Super Slow Motion"" movies that slow down action by a factor of eight. In three appendices, the book provides information about accessories available for the camera, including cases, a filter adapter, and external flash units; contains a list of useful web sites and other resources for further information; and includes a section with helpful Quick Tips that give particular insights into how to take advantage of the camera's features in the most efficient ways possible.",,4.7

[..] An excellent start to a brave new series."" -Ysabeau Wilce, award-winning author of the Flora Segunda series RANDOM My name is Jazz Marsh. I am a Random Were, which means I am a Were of no fixed form - like all Random Were, my family can become any warm-blooded creature which is the last thing they see before they Turn. For me, when my time came, that meant... trouble. I was quite young when I lost my older sister, Celia, and my family never spoke about her. It was only when I found the secret diaries that she had left behind that I began to discover the truth behind her life and her death. I never understood what drove my moody and dangerous older brother until I began to get an inkling about his part in Celia's death... and until, driven to the edge of patience and understanding, he finally had to face his own Turn problems... and disastrously took matters into his own hands. One thing is clear. Everything I thought I knew about Were-kind was wrong. THIS IS BOOK ONE IN THE WERECHRONICLES SERIES",$14.95,4.5

They embark on a furtive love affair, and are soon cloistered in a premature intimacy by the unrest roiling their city. When it explodes, turning familiar streets into a patchwork of checkpoints and bomb blasts, they begin to hear whispers about doors—doors that can whisk people far away, if perilously and for a price.

Before he was born, his family was disfigured by a fire. His sister wears a white mask to cover her burns.He spends his hours with his cactus, reading his book on insects, or touching the one ray of sunlight that filters in through a crack in the ceiling. Ever since his sister had a baby, everyone’s been acting very strangely. The boy begins to wonder why they never say who the father is, about what happened before his own birth, about why they’re shut away.A few days ago, some fireflies arrived in the basement. His grandma said, There’s no creature more amazing than one that can make its own light. That light makes the boy want to escape, to know the outside world. Problem is, all the doors are locked.

In prose that reads like the flowing current of a river, scholar and essayist George Handley blends nature writing, local history, theology, environmental history, and personal memoir in his new book Home Waters: A Year of Recompenses on the Provo River. Handley’s meditations on the local Provo River watershed present the argument that a sense of place requires more than a strong sense of history and belonging, it requires awareness and commitment. Handley traces a history of settlement along the Provo that has profoundly transformed the landscape and yet neglected its Native American and environmental legacies. As a descendent of one of the first pioneers to irrigate the area, and as a witness to the loss of orchards, open space, and an eroded environmental ethic, Handley weaves his own personal and family history into the landscape to argue for sustainable belonging. In avoiding the exclusionist and environmentally harmful attitudes that come with the territorial claims to a homeland, the flyfishing term, “home waters,” is offered as an alternative, a kind of belonging that is informed by deference to others, to the mysteries of deep time, and to a fragile dependence on water. While it has sometimes been mistakenly assumed that the Mormon faith is inimical to good environmental stewardship, Handley explores the faith’s openness to science, its recognition of the holiness of the creation, and its call for an ethical engagement with nature. A metaphysical approach to the physical world is offered as an antidote to the suicidal impulses of modern society and our persistent ambivalence about the facts of our biology and earthly condition. Home Waters contributes a perspective from within the Mormon religious experience to the tradition of such Western writers as Wallace Stegner, Terry Tempest Williams, Steven Trimble, and Amy Irvine.

By allocating only small quotas to the nations of southern and eastern Europe, and banning almost all immigration from Asia, the new laws were supposed to stem the tide of foreigners considered especially inferior and dangerous. However, immigrants continued to come, sailing into the port of New York with fake passports, or from Cuba to Florida, hidden in the holds of boats loaded with contraband liquor. Jews, one of the main targets of the quota laws, figured prominently in the new international underworld of illegal immigration. However, they ultimately managed to escape permanent association with the identity of the “illegal alien” in a way that other groups, such as Mexicans, thus far, have not. In After They Closed the Gates, Libby Garland tells the untold stories of the Jewish migrants and smugglers involved in that underworld, showing how such stories contributed to growing national anxieties about illegal immigration. Garland also helps us understand how Jews were linked to, and then unlinked from, the specter of illegal immigration. By tracing this complex history, Garland offers compelling insights into the contingent nature of citizenship, belonging, and Americanness.",$38.00,2.5

The book includes a discussion of techniques for using the camera’s phenomenal zoom lens, with a maximum focal length of 1440mm, to full advantage, and explains the benefits of using the camera’s Raw format for capturing still images.  The book also discusses the camera’s features for image transfer and remote control using Nikon’s SnapBridge app, which uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi networks to accomplish these tasks wirelessly. The book includes sample images taken using the creative settings of the camera, including the Picture Control settings, which alter the color processing of images, and the Scene and Creative shooting modes, with settings optimized for subjects such as landscapes, portraits, pets, sunsets, and action shots. The book also explains the camera’s features for burst shooting and time-lapse photography. In addition, the book provides introductions to topics such as infrared photography, street photography, and macro photography. The book also explains the video recording abilities of the Coolpix B700, which can shoot 4K and HD video with stereo sound and can record clips of high-speed video at rates up to 4 times normal speed, for playback in slow motion. In addition, the book describes procedures for playing back images and videos in the camera and for using the Filter Effects option to add special effects to images after they have been captured. In three appendices, the book discusses accessories for the Coolpix B700, including cases, external flash units, and charging and power options. The appendices include a list of useful web sites and other resources, as well as a section with “quick tips” to help users take advantage of the camera’s features in the most efficient ways possible. This guide book to the B700 camera includes a detailed Table of Contents and Index.",$24.95,4.6

Tallamy, Rick Darke",Timber Press," “If you cut down the goldenrod, the wild black cherry, the milkweed and other natives, you eliminate the larvae, and starve the birds. This simple revelation about the food web—and it is an intricate web, not a chain—is the driving force in Bringing Nature Home.” —The New York Times As development and subsequent habitat destruction accelerate, there are increasing pressures on wildlife populations. But there is an important and simple step toward reversing this alarming trend: Everyone with access to a patch of earth can make a significant contribution toward sustaining biodiversity. There is an unbreakable link between native plant species and native wildlife—native insects cannot, or will not, eat alien plants. When native plants disappear, the insects disappear, impoverishing the food source for birds and other animals. In many parts of the world, habitat destruction has been so extensive that local wildlife is in crisis and may be headed toward extinction.Bringing Nature Home has sparked a national conversation about the link between healthy local ecosystems and human well-being, and the new paperback edition—with an expanded resource section and updated photos—will help broaden the movement. By acting on Douglas Tallamy's practical recommendations, everyone can make a difference.",$15.40,4.8

Imagine a series of stories set in a golden era of American life, where worldly troubles are regarded from a distance, if at all. Hear the buzz of playing cards clipped in children’s spokes echo down quiet lanes. Smell the faint aroma of rich tobacco smoke from an old man’s pipe on a shady boulevard. Listen to the gossip of small towns where everyone knows everyone’s business. Or do they?  Sometimes, deadly secrets lurk out in the barn. Sometimes, unimaginable evil awaits us in the root cellar. Sometimes, we fall under the sway of the Shadows Over Main Street.  Contains stories and poems by: Gary Braunbeck, Nick Mamatas, Josh Malerman, Mary SanGiovanni, Tim Curran, Rena Mason, Lucy A. Snyder, Stephanie Wytovich, Kevin Lucia, Chesya Burke, Brian Hodge, James Chambers, Aaron Polson, T.

None of them thought they'd be facing down forty and still wondering when life starts. What they do when they realize where they're headed is both inspiring and wildly entertaining.

This book had me laughing at some points, and it had me wiping away tears at others.”– Comfy Reading“After about two pages I was hooked.”– Glitter and Cookies“An awesome read!

Hurriedly he found a book and added it to the height of the stool. She stepped up higher and her horrified executioner tugged the rope tight under her chin. He dare not look at her, for the spell would strike him. Instead, he subtly slipped the magic stone into the hands tied behind her back.  “When you fall, wish with all your might for the ropes to break. Then, Gailin, run for your life.”  She tried to look down at the hangman at that startling message, but it was too late. He kicked the stool out from under her feet and ran.  Thus begins the next saga in the Wise Ones series. New pawns introduced to magic and manipulation in a game they do not even know they are playing; the game of the Ley Lines.",$10.99,4.5

Overjoyed when their fathers arrange a match, her dreams of a loving union are waylaid when she meets George's sister, Anne. For George is completely devoted to his sister, and cold and indifferent to his bride. As Anne acquires a wide circle of admirers, including King Henry, Jane's resentment grows. But if becoming Henry's queen makes Anne the most powerful woman in England, it also makes her highly vulnerable. And as Henry, desperate for a male heir, begins to tire of his mercurial wife, the stage is set for the ultimate betrayal. . .Encompassing the reigns of four of Henry's wives, from the doomed Anne to the reckless Katherine Howard, The Boleyn Wife is an unforgettable story of ambition, lust, and jealousy, of the power of love to change the course of history, and of the terrible price of revenge.",$19.22,3.4

56976,440509173,book,paperback,Left for Dead (Movie Tie-in Edition): My Journey Home from Everest,"Beck Weathers, Stephen G. Michaud",Bantam," With a new preface by the author • As featured in the upcoming motion picture Everest, starring Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Emily Watson, Keira Knightley, Sam Worthington, and Jake Gyllenhaal   “I can tell you that some force within me rejected death at the last moment and then guided me, blind and stumbling—quite literally a dead man walking—into camp and the shaky start of my return to life.”   In 1996 Beck Weathers and a climbing team pushed toward the summit of Mount Everest. Then a storm exploded on the mountain, ripping the team to shreds, forcing brave men to scratch and crawl for their lives. Rescuers who reached Weathers saw that he was dying, and left him. Twelve hours later, the inexplicable occurred. Weathers appeared, blinded, gloveless, and caked with ice—walking down the mountain. In this powerful memoir, now featuring a new Preface, Weathers describes not only his escape from hypothermia and the murderous storm that killed eight climbers, but the journey of his life. This is the story of a man’s route to a dangerous sport and a fateful expedition, as well as the road of recovery he has traveled since; of survival in the face of certain death, the reclaiming of a family and a life; and of the most extraordinary adventure of all: finding the courage to say yes when life offers us a second chance.   Praise for Left for Dead   “Riveting . . . [a] remarkable survival story . . . Left for Dead takes a long, critical look at climbing: Weathers is particularly candid about how the demanding sport altered and strained his relationships.”—USA Today   “Ultimately, this engrossing tale depicts the difficulty of a man’s struggle to reform his life.”—Publishers Weekly",$13.39,3.7

Seventeen-year-old Sally Spitz is done with dating. Or at least, she's done with the horrible blind dates/hookups/sneak attacks her matchmaking bestie, Hooker, sets her up on. There's only so much one geek girl and Gryffindor supporter can take. Her solution: she needs a fake boyfriend. And fast. Enter Becks, soccer phenom, all-around-hottie, and Sally's best friend practically since birth. When Sally asks Becks to be her F.B.F. (fake boyfriend), Becks is only too happy to be used. He'd do anything for Sal--even if that means giving her PDA lessons in his bedroom, saying she's ""more than pretty,"" and expertly kissing her at parties. The problem: Sally's been in love with Becks all her life--and he's completely clueless. This book features two best friends, one special edition Yoda snuggie, countless beneath-the-ear kisses and begs the question: Who wants a real boyfriend when faking it is so much more fun?",$14.99,4.6

Rest assured that the book is not mere theory. Ericsson’s research focuses on the real world, and he explains in detail, with examples, how all of us can apply the principles of great performance in our work or in any other part of our lives.”—Fortune Anders Ericsson has made a career studying chess champions, violin virtuosos, star athletes, and memory mavens. Peak distills three decades of myth-shattering research into a powerful learning strategy that is fundamentally different from the way people traditionally think about acquiring new abilities. Whether you want to stand out at work, improve your athletic or musical performance, or help your child achieve academic goals, Ericsson’s revolutionary methods will show you how to improve at almost any skill that matters to you.  “The science of excellence can be divided into two eras: before Ericsson and after Ericsson. His groundbreaking work, captured in this brilliantly useful book, provides us with a blueprint for achieving the most important and life-changing work possible: to become a little bit better each day.”—Dan Coyle, author of The Talent Code  “Ericsson’s research has revolutionized how we think about human achievement. If everyone would take the lessons of this book to heart, it could truly change the world.”—Joshua Foer, author of Moonwalking with Einstein ",$10.87,4.5

Denn wenn ein Hund verhaltensauffällig wird, hat das fast immer einen Grund: Er wird nicht als Hund behandelt, sondern als Mensch mit Fell.

What if we let go of the very need to know? Unknowing is at the centre of spiritual life.

Norton & Company," “Bonnie Jo Campbell is a master of rural America’s postindustrial landscape.” ―Boston GlobeNamed by the Guardian as one of our top ten writers of rural noir, Bonnie Jo Campbell is a keen observer of life and trouble in rural America, and her working-class protagonists can be at once vulnerable, wise, cruel, and funny. The strong but flawed women of Mothers, Tell Your Daughters must negotiate a sexually charged atmosphere as they love, honor, and betray one another against the backdrop of all the men in their world. Such richly fraught mother-daughter relationships can be lifelines, anchors, or they can sink a woman like a stone.In ""My Dog Roscoe,"" a new bride becomes obsessed with the notion that her dead ex-boyfriend has returned to her in the form of a mongrel. In ""Blood Work, 1999,"" a phlebotomist's desire to give away everything to the needy awakens her own sensuality. In ""Home to Die,"" an abused woman takes revenge on her bedridden husband. In these fearless and darkly funny tales about women and those they love, Campbell’s spirited American voice is at its most powerful.",$12.82,4.0

It’s also a story about how girl meets herself, does some crazy things and learns to love herself. And to really love others. But I’m getting ahead of myself. Filled with not-so-quiet reflection, self-deprecation and ridiculous men (including favorites like the kilt-wearing Subway Pirate and a foot fetishist who just loves to watch me chew), this book is for every girl who has ever tried to climb out the bathroom window in stiletto heels—and men who have done the same (minus the stilettos…I’m guessing).",,3.2

This is the last transmission received from Caitlin Palamara's audit team. What could never happen is now a terrifying fact. The five-person crew of the ISEA audit ship jack-a-dandy has vanished during a routine skip from sector ship Graywand to the planet Sierra. Palamara and the others find themselves stranded on a hostile, undeveloped planet that bears no resemblance at all to Sierra. They've lost communication with Graywand, and their drive system is dead. Just when it seems that things can't get worse, John Wheeler, who feels a connection with a mysterious alien presence, wanders off and stumbles upon the sprawling ruins of an ancient city. The others have no choice but to go after him. The place is more than a little spooky. But there's no real danger, right? The city is long dead, abandoned eons ago. Right? Wrong. For Caitlin Palamara's small audit team, it's the end of their comfortable routine, and the beginning of the interstellar nightmare that becomes known in ISEA archives as The Tartarus Incident.",$12.95,4.5

Temples are places of worship, oceans of tranquillity, or so everyone thinks, till a series of murders threatens to destroy the carefully cultivated reputation of the royal family of Thiruvanathapuram. And when fingers point towards the opening of the hitherto sealed vaults at the Padmanabha Swamy Temple that is under the control of the royals, all hell breaks loose. Meanwhile, a heist at the Wafi Mall in Dubai leads investigators to uncover a massive racket in the smuggling of antiques from the ruins of temples in south India. Things only get murkier when multiple blasts in Mumbai shake the very foundations of the diamond trade in the country. Is there a connection between these incidents? Who is behind the murders? Follow Kabir Khan, Additional Director, CBI, as he breezes through a complex maze of fact and fiction, faith and deceit, religion and commerce to unravel the mystery and unmask the killers with only minutes left at his disposal. Slick, riveting and fast paced, In the Name of God is Ravi Subramanian s most gripping novel yet.",$7.03,3.7

Kamoroff C.P.A.,Lyons Press," Are you paying more taxes than you have to? The IRS is certainly not going to tell you about a deduction you failed to take, and your accountant is not likely to take the time to ask you about every deduction you’re entitled to. As former IRS Commissioner Mark Everson admitted, “If you don’t claim it, you don’t get it. That’s money down the drain for millions of Americans.” This invaluable book, updated to reflect changes in tax law, not only lists the individual items that are deductible—from Internet domain name costs to theft losses—but also explains where to list them on your income tax form. “Tax law isn’t easy,” the author explains, “but this book is.” The twelfth edition will be completely updated to include new changes in tax law, a chapter on home-based businesses, and include a special “jump out” highlights in the A-to-Z listings for any deduction that has special rules for home-based businesses.",$13.36,4.2

Every day he thinks of ways he might kill himself, but every day he also searches for—and manages to find—something to keep him here, and alive, and awake.   Violet Markey lives for the future, counting the days until graduation, when she can escape her small Indiana town and her aching grief in the wake of her sister’s recent death.   When Finch and Violet meet on the ledge of the bell tower at school—six stories above the ground— it’s unclear who saves whom. Soon it’s only with Violet that Finch can be himself. And it’s only with Finch that Violet can forget to count away the days and start living them. But as Violet’s world grows, Finch’s begins to shrink. . . .     “A do-not-miss for fans of Eleanor & Park and The Fault in Our Stars, and basically anyone who can breathe.” —Justine Magazine   “At the heart—a big one—of All the Bright Places lies a charming love story about this unlikely and endearing pair of broken teenagers.” —The New York Times Book Review    “A heart-rending, stylish love story.” —The Wall Street Journal   “A complex love story that will bring all the feels.” —Seventeen Magazine   “Impressively layered, lived-in, and real.” —Buzzfeed.com",$8.24,4.6

A Deep Dive into the Story of God  Fathom is a Bible study for teens that covers the Old and New Testaments in 18 4-session studies. The lessons are a blend of narrative and traditional theological approaches to understanding the Bible story. Each lesson will focus on one passage that will launch into the larger context of God's story, and how that story is meant to be theirs. Fathom is suitable for groups with middle schoolers, high schoolers, and any combination of the two. Acknowledges the differences between older and younger youth and the way they learn. It provides activities specific to each age group, and gives leaders the option to let youth take ownership of their learning through teaching and leading alongside adults. Fathom creates space and tension for teens to wrestle with how to interpret and experience the Bible.   Through youthministrypartners.com, leaders will have access to planning and teaching tools, to support their use of Fathom as well as their youth ministries in general.   ",$6.11,

The media warned people to stay inside until the swarm passed. But the flies didn't leave. And then the radios and TVs went silent.That's when the spiders came. Spiders that could spin a deadly web large enough to engulf an entire house overnight. Spiders that left stripped bones behind as they multiplied. Spiders that, like the flies, sought hungrily for tender flesh... through Violet Eyes.",,4.0

When the long-awaited wedding day arrives, there is more unfolding than just Clive and Henrietta’s vows of love. Stanley and Elsie’s relationship is sorely tested by the presence of the dashing Lieutenant Harrison Barnes-Smith and by Henrietta’s friend Rose―a situation that grows increasingly dark and confused as time goes on.As Clive and Henrietta begin their honeymoon at Castle Linley, the Howards’ ancestral estate in England, they encounter a whole new host of characters, including the eccentric Lord and Lady Linley and Clive’s mysterious cousin, Wallace. When a man is murdered in the village on the night of a house party at the Castle, Wallace comes under suspicion―and Clive and Henrietta are reluctantly drawn into the case, despite Clive’s anxiety at involving his new bride and Henrietta’s distracting news from home.Delicately attempting to work together for the first time, Clive and Henrietta set out to prove Wallace’s innocence, uncovering as they do so some rather shocking truths that will shake the Linley name and estate forever.",$11.56,4.3

57678,807853526,book,paperback,The Planter's Prospect: Privilege and Slavery in Plantation Paintings,John Michael Vlach,The University of North Carolina Press," Although nineteenth-century American landscapes typically were painted from a high vantage point, looking down from above, southern landscapes that featured plantations diverged from this convention in telling ways. Portraits of planters' landholdings were often depicted from a point below the plantation house, a perspective that directs the viewer's gaze upward and, as John Vlach observes, echoes the deference and respect the planter class assumed was its due. Moreover, Vlach notes, slaves were rarely represented in plantation paintings made before the Civil War, although it was slave labor that powered the plantation system. After the war and the abolition of slavery, he argues, a wistful revisionism seems to have restored these people--still toiling in the service of the masters--to the landscapes they had created and on which they were so cruelly mistreated. This richly illustrated book explores the statements of power and ironic evasions encoded in plantation landscapes, focusing on six artists whose collective body of work spans the period between 1800 and 1935 and documents plantations across the South, from Maryland to Louisiana: Francis Guy, Charles Fraser, Adrien Persac, Currier & Ives chief artist Fanny Palmer, William Aiken Walker, and Alice Ravenel Huger Smith.",,5.0

Abrams," An exploration of 365 days of shared experiences between two friends on opposite sides of the country, inspired by their blog, 3191 Miles Apart.   Maria Alexandra Vettese and Stephanie Congdon Barnes share a love of art and design, handmade pleasures, and a well-lived domestic life. Almost a decade ago, they began their first year-long project together, posting a photo from each of their mornings on their blog, 3191 Miles Apart, named for the distance between their homes in Portland, Maine, and Portland, Oregon. 3191 Miles Apart quickly acquired a worldwide following of readers drawn in by the delicate intimacy of their shared experiences.  A Year Between Friends celebrates their most recent project together—a visual representation of 2015, month-by-month, side-by-side, but miles apart. In addition to 400 photographs recording their daily inspirations and creative undertakings and a foreword from New York Times bestselling author Molly Wizenberg, this unique collaboration expands on their prior work with over 25 handmade crafts and seasonal recipes, notes on simple living, and personal stories that follow the tide of a year filled with new life, change, and loss. It is an intimate joint portrait revealed through photographic snippets—mending a sweater, making a mobile from a cherished collection, creating fabric dyes from natural materials, baking scones—that defies distance through the celebration of shared moments of calmness, warmth, and family. Both aspirational and down-to-earth, A Year Between Friends is an inspiring visual love letter to friendship and creativity, a timeless reminder to appreciate life one day at a time, to slow down, to cherish simplicity, and to make the extra effort to do things with care and with the people we love.",$16.96,5.0

As Evelyn’s life was an enigma before her marriage into the Bozeman family, Alexis makes it her sole mission to understand who her grandmother was and the kind of life she left behind. Although Tyler Jameson grew up on a neighboring ranch, he was a staple on the Bozeman farm, where he, Alexis, and her brother were constant companions - until the day they weren’t. His appreciation for Alexis always stopped just short of flirting, but now that she’s back in town, she’s more of a distraction that he could ever imagine. Before they realize it, Evelyn’s secrets draw them into a power struggle with a family from Evelyn’s past. A family that will stop at nothing to keep their secrets buried, even if that means taking more lives. See what happens when Alexis and Tyler are reintroduced after life has molded them into perfect partners whether they know it or not. Read along to learn how a little heavenly help via a deceased grandmother, helps give them a push. And, find out if Evelyn can protect her granddaughter from the wheels she put in motion before it's too late?",$14.99,5.0

Their secrets would be buried, bound in blood … Years later, a headmistress is found brutally strangled, the first in a spate of gruesome murders which shock the Black Country. But when human remains are discovered at a former children’s home, disturbing secrets are also unearthed. D.I. Kim Stone fast realises she’s on the hunt for a twisted individual whose killing spree spans decades. As the body count rises, Kim needs to stop the murderer before they strike again. But to catch the killer, can Kim confront the demons of her own past before it’s too late?

Kim Stone A Detective hiding dark secrets, Kim Stone will stop at nothing to protect the innocent. Silent Scream is the first book in the series – watch out for EVIL GAMES coming soon. What people are saying about Silent Scream ‘A superb debut by an assured new writer. Blending sharp wit with emotion, I thoroughly enjoyed the ride alongside DI Kim Stone and look forward to the next outing.’ Mel Sherratt ‘I started reading ‘Silent Scream’ thinking I would just read a few chapters. I ended up reading it all… I love it when an author chooses a dark topic and does it incredibly well… An excellent read and one I would happily recommend.’ Northern Crime ‘This is a fantastic debut novel by Marsons. The blurb said that if you were a fan of Val McDermid and Mark Billingham you would love this book and being a huge fan of both I thought I would give it a go and I was pleasantly surprised… With lots of twists and turns this is a real page turner and I would highly recommend it.’ The Laughing Librarian",,4.3

This author has a talent for telling a story and telling it well.” – ABNA Breakthrough Novel Award ""Like the nesting dolls of the title, the story moves backward through time, masterfully disclosing the mysteries of three generations of dysfunction. What we learn is that violence and alcoholism are not random, but historical . . . Lyrical and passionate, NESTING DOLLS is an excellent debut."" -- Kaylie Jones, author of LIES MY MOTHER NEVER TOLD ME Seventeen-year-old Valentine never imagined her life as a fairytale. Growing up, she's barely getting by, spending her time, energy, and money caring for her younger brother, Jonathon, and herself. Her mother lives recklessly and selfishly, occasionally sobering just enough to see her children through glassy eyes. After yet another violent episode involving her mother’s boyfriend, Valentine decides to run away, taking Jonathon with her. In search of a better life, she gets half-way across the country . . . only to receive such shocking news, it forces her to turn the car around. Twenty years earlier, Valentine’s mother Theresa, the privileged daughter of a small-town police chief and a strict, repressive mother, finds herself desperate and devoid of options when she lands in Los Angeles, 13 years old, pregnant, and utterly without a clue. Life on the street is ten times meaner than she ever imagined, and as she struggles to get through each day, week, and month, she holds on to the hope of finally getting herself back to upper-class suburban bliss . . . if she can only make it out of LA in one piece. And twenty years before even that, in suburbia, Theresa’s mother, Caroline, plays the part of doting wife like a pro, but behind the designer skirts and lipstick smiles lies a married life of severe physical and emotional abuse. After having two children, Caroline settles into the idea of living in home with a man who terrifies her…only to have the love of her life show up on her doorstep, asking her to make a choice that will forever change her path and those of the women who will come after her. NESTING DOLLS is the multigenerational story of three women, how their lives connect and diverge, and how they support or betray each other due to circumstances and the choices they make. Their lives each span a different time, a different life, but ultimately converge in a single theme: how mothers and daughters are truly bound together forever, no matter what they may imagine, dream, or regret. ""By turns poignant, funny, and frightening, NESTING DOLLS is a gorgeously-written reverse fairy tale the reader will be reluctant to set down."" - Lenore Hart, author of BECKY and THE RAVEN'S BRIDE",$13.95,4.6

Why is there so much global upheaval on so many levels? Where is the world heading? Why are terrorist activities and other threats continuing to increase? In this informative and prophetically stirring book, Perry Stone answers these questions and more as he details a large-scale picture of what will occur in the time of the end.Revealing the plan of God evident from the beginning of time, Stone identifies:?? Six major empires that have risen on the world scene and then faded into the fog of history?? The seventh empire that will exist for a short period, followed by the eighth and final empire, identified as the kingdom of the beast?? The link between biblical prophecies and Islamic traditions that point to the rise of this coming eighth kingdom, and a final global dictator who will seize the world",,4.6

The novel follows the outsize adventures of Billy Clyde Puckett, star halfback for the New York Giants, whose team has come to Los Angeles for an epic duel with the despised ""dog-ass"" Jets in the Super Bowl. But Billy Clyde is faced with a dual challenge: not only must he try to run over a bunch of malevolents incarnate, but he has also been commissioned by a New York book publisher to keep a journal of the events leading up to, including, and following the game. Infused with Dan Jenkins's characteristic joie de vivre and replete with cigarettes, whiskey, and wild women, Semi-Tough is an uproarious romp through a lost era of professional sports that will have any armchair quarterback falling out of his or her recliner in hysterics on a semi-regular basis.",$15.95,4.0

It may take some time to figure this out, as you hear voices from nowhere, or see shadows lurking around with no explanation, maybe there are spirits that didn't cross over or lost. In this book many questions will be answered. What happens the moment we die? Is there a light? Are angels and demons real? Is Lucifer real, can he appear? I collected the stories of spirits in my house and they explain exactly how they died and their personal experience, age, name, and year that they passed on. I also interviewed demons, angels, and yes, Lucifer, all real true stories, that I am sure you would love to read. This is a must read book that you just can't avoid to pick up.",$12.95,3.0

With over a million subscribers to her cult-hit video series “You Deserve a Drink,” Hart has been entertaining viewers with a combination of tasty libations and raunchy puns since 2011. Hart also co-wrote/co-starred in Dirty Thirty and Camp Takota with Grace Helbig and Hannah Hart.Finally, Hart has compiled her best drinking stories—and worst hangovers—into one hilarious volume. From the spring break where she and her girlfriends avoided tan lines by staying at an all-male gay nudist resort, to the bachelorette party where she accidentally hired a sixty-year-old meth head to teach the group pole dancing (not to mention the time she lit herself on fire during a Flaming Lips concert), Hart accompanies each story with an original cocktail recipe, ensuring that You Deserve a Drink is as educational as it is entertaining.     With cameos from familiar friends from the YouTube scene and a foreword by Grace Helbig, this glimpse into Hart’s life brings warmth and humor to the woman fans know and love. And for readers who haven’t met Mamrie yet—take a warm-up shot and break out the cocktail shaker: you’re going to need a drink.“Hart is a pull-no-punches comedian with a talent for self-deprecation in the guise of self-aggrandizement, a winning formula.”—The New York Times ",$11.49,4.8

Unfortunately, it’s not always clear that the work a person does with kids is really making a lasting difference. Ask children’s ministry leaders and kid-influencers if they are making the impact on children’s lives as they had hoped and most likely the responses will be mixed. And for good reason. Research over the past decade has revealed an alarming lack of long-term growth in the faith community as children progress through student ministries into adulthood.Clearly, something needs to change.Relational Children’s Ministry seeks to reverse this trend by equipping children’s ministry leaders with practical tools to disrupt the status quo approach to discipleship with children and realign their ministries for greater long-term impact. Ministry leaders will:Learn how to relate intentionally to kids and families by putting five discipleship invitations modeled by Jesus into practiceExplore practical approaches to realign their children’s ministry for a new trajectory by hitting three “reset buttons” to ensure long-term discipleship is embeddedEncounter examples of disruptive disciple-makers in action and learn key principles that can be translated into their own ministry contextChildren’s ministry leaders will receive practical training to refocus their children’s ministry along with time-tested tools to personally recommit to lifelong discipleship. Kid-influencers can become a disciple-making community that redirects the current trajectory for this and future generations.",$9.35,4.5

They are not alone. Jingjing must contend with a rival he could never have anticipated, while Xanther must relinquish all she thought she knew as a far greater responsibility is set before her. Light wavers and pomegranates reveal their price as the effects of a great transition start to reverberate around everyone, Shnorhk’s efforts to resume playing music cannot escape history’s ghosts. Cas, in upstate New York, comes face-to-face with her lifelong nemesis in a candlelit rendezvous that presages the international crisis soon to come. As more lines tangle, Özgür and Luther brawl with a future that may have chosen them long ago, and Isandòrno crosses a line that will force him over the border into a country he has until now steadfastly refused. All the while, a terrible power roaming the world continues to grow . . .",$19.00,4.9

Ishma came to the prophet's home, devastated after watching her family destroyed and living as a captive. But as the years pass, Zibah's lively spirit wins Prince Hezekiah's favor, a boy determined to rebuild the kingdom his father has nearly destroyed. But loving this man will awake in her all the fears and pain of her past and she must turn to the only One who can give life, calm her fears, and deliver a nation.    ""Andrews (The Pharaoh’s Daughter) offers her unique brand of in-depth Bible knowledge and storytelling flair ... [she] is gifted at bringing the past to life..."" —Publishers Weekly (starred review)",$13.49,4.8

Five years later, his estranged brother, Avram, returns to the city to search out the truth behind his brother's suspicious death. Living in his brother's crumbling island mansion, befriending his enigmatic staff, Avram steadily unearths deeper layers of the tragedy. Yet the more his actions echo his brother's fraught experience, the more dangerous the exercise of digging up another person's history becomes. Through the lens of Avram's discoveries, Isles of the Blind explores the overlapping heritage of Jews and Armenians in a rapidly changing Muslim society. How should a man define himself, and towards what personal, religious and national obligations should our loyalties bend?",$17.95,5.0

Here are Miriam, Esther, Dinah, Lilith and many other women of the Torah in dialogue with Jewish daughters, mothers and grandmothers, past and present. Together these voices examine and debate every aspect of a Jewish woman's life -- work, sex, marriage, her connection to God and her place in the Jewish community and in the world. The Five Books of Miriam makes an invaluable contribution to Torah study and adds rich dimension to the ongoing conversation between Jewish women and Jewish tradition.",$16.99,4.2

Sandra Grimes and Jeanne Vertefeuille were two of the five principals of the CIA team tasked with hunting one of their own and were directly responsible for identifying Ames as the mole, leading to his arrest and conviction.One of the most destructive traitors in American history, CIA officer Aldrich Ames provided information to the Soviet Union that contributed to the deaths of at least ten Soviet intelligence officers who spied for the United States. In this book, the two CIA officers directly responsible for tracking down Ames chronicle their involvement in the hunt for a mole. Considering it their personal mission, Grimes and Vertefeuille dedicated themselves to identifying the traitor responsible for the execution or imprisonment of the Soviet agents with whom they worked. Their efforts eventually led them to a long-time acquaintance and coworker in the CIA's Soviet-East European division and Counterintelligence Center, Aldrich Ames.Not only is this the first book to be written by the CIA principals involved, but it is also the first to provide details of the operational contact with the agents Ames betrayed. The book covers the political aftermath of Ames's arrest, including the Congressional wrath for not identifying him sooner, the FBI/CIA debriefings following Ames's plea bargain, and a retrospective of Ames the person and Ames the spy. It is also the compelling story of two female agents, who overcame gender barriers and succeeded in bringing Ames to justice in a historically male-oriented organization. Now retired from the CIA, Grimes and Vertefeuille are finally able to tell this inside story of the CIA's most notorious traitor and the men he betrayed.",$16.92,4.1

But for those born around then, this era of childhood feels like yesterday. 1950s Ireland was the age of De Valera and John Charles McQuaid. It was the age before television, before Vatican II, and before home central heating. It was a time when motor cars and public telephones had wind-up handles, when boys wore short trousers and girls wore ribbons, when nuns wore white bonnets and priests wore black hats in church.This delightful collection of nostalgic photographs and memories will appeal to all who grew up in 1950s Ireland and will jog memories about all aspects of life as it was.",$16.95,

58809,1937986101,book,paperback,Photographer's Guide to the Panasonic Lumix LX7,Alexander S. White,White Knight Press," The Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX7 has earned a reputation as one of the first choices for photographers who want an advanced camera they can carry around with them to capture great images without the complication and weight of a DSLR or other large camera. With features such as a very fast lens with an aperture of f/1.4, excellent image quality, and a solid array of burst-shooting capabilities, this compact camera has attracted an enthusiastic following in the photography community. However, the camera does not come with a detailed printed manual for reference, making it difficult for users to find answers to questions about the use of the camera's many controls, menus, and features. With the release of this guide book to the LX7, White Knight Press has provided users with a comprehensive guide to all operations of this sophisticated camera. Using a patient, tutorial-like approach, the book provides guidance to beginning and intermediate photographers not only about how to accomplish things with the LX7, but when and why to use the camera's many controls, menus options, and other features. The book does not assume specialized knowledge by the reader as it explains topics such as autofocus, manual focus, depth of field, aperture priority, shutter priority, exposure compensation, white balance, and ISO sensitivity. The book also provides details about the camera's numerous menu options for playback, setup, and customizing the operation of the various buttons and other controls. The book contains approximately 400 photographs, almost all in full color, which illustrate the LX7's controls, shooting screens, and menus. The photographs also provide examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the Creative Control settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing and other aspects of images; the Scene shooting mode, with settings that are optimized for various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and action shots; the Photo Style menu option, which provides the ability to customize the appearance of images; and the camera's strong array of features for continuous shooting and shooting in dim lighting. In addition, the book goes beyond the bounds of everyday photography, and provides introductions to more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, astrophotography, and macro photography. The book also includes a full discussion of the video recording abilities of the LX7, which can shoot high-definition (HD) video with stereo sound, and which offers manual control of exposure and focus during movie recording. In three appendices, the book provides information about accessories available for the camera, including cases, external flash units, and filter adapters, and includes a list of web sites and other resources for further information. Also, the book includes a detailed appendix with helpful Quick Tips that give particular insights into how to take advantage of the camera's features in the most efficient ways possible.",$24.95,4.7

The result is this astonishing first-person account of a pioneer woman who braved grueling work, profound tragedy, and a pitiless wilderness (she and her family faced floods, tornadoes, fires, bears, panthers, and snakes) to protect her home in the early American South. An early draft of Trials of the Earth was submitted to a writers' competition sponsored by Little, Brown in 1933. It didn't win, and we almost lost the chance to bring this raw, vivid narrative to readers. Eighty-three years later, in partnership with Mary Mann Hamilton's descendants, we're proud to share this irreplaceable piece of American history. Written in spare, rich prose, Trials of the Earth is a precious record of one woman's extraordinary endurance and courage that will resonate with readers of history and fiction alike.",$9.98,4.6

Albert Mohler Jr.",Zondervan," Historians and theologians alike have long recognized that at the heart of the sixteenth-century Protestant Reformation were five declarations (or “solas”) that distinguished the movement from other expressions of the Christian faith.Five hundred years later, we live in a different time with fresh challenges to our faith. Yet these rallying cries of the Reformation continue to speak to us, addressing a wide range of contemporary issues. The Five Solas series will help you understand the historical and biblical context of the five solas and how to live out the relevance of Reformation theology today.In God’s Word Alone—The Authority of Scripture, scholar and pastor Matthew Barrett looks at the historical and biblical roots of the doctrine that Scripture alone is the final and decisive authority for God’s people. He examines the development of this theme in the Reformation and traces the crisis that followed resulting in a shift away from the authority of Scripture. Barrett shows that we need to recover a robust doctrine of Scripture’s authority in the face of today’s challenges and why a solid doctrinal foundation built on God’s Word is the best hope for the future of the church.",$16.99,4.5

Physical abuse, deprivation and tragedy plagued his early years, yet through sheer force of character he was able to overcome these obstacles to become a leading spokesman for his people.In this, the first and most frequently read of his three autobiographies, Douglass provides graphic descriptions of his childhood and horrifying experiences as a slave as well as a harrowing record of his dramatic escape to the North and eventual freedom.Published in 1845 to quell doubts about his origins — since few slaves of that period could write — the Narrative is admired today for its extraordinary passion, sensitive and vivid descriptions and storytelling power. It belongs in the library of anyone interested in African-American history and the life of one of the country's most courageous and influential champions of civil rights.",$3.00,4.6

More than two decades after the end of the Cold War, the United States still stations its troops at nearly a thousand locations in foreign lands. These bases are usually taken for granted or overlooked entirely, a little-noticed part of the Pentagon’s vast operations. But in an eye-opening account, Base Nation shows that the worldwide network of bases brings with it a panoply of ills and actually makes the nation less safe in the long run. As David Vine demonstrates, the overseas bases raise geopolitical tensions and provoke widespread antipathy towards the United States. They also undermine American democratic ideals, pushing the United States into partnerships with dictators and perpetuating a system of second-class citizenship in territories such as Guam. They breed sexual violence, destroy the environment, and damage local economies. And their financial cost is staggering: though the Pentagon underplays the numbers, Vine’s accounting proves that the bill approaches $100 billion per year. For many decades, the need for overseas bases has been a quasi-religious dictum of U.S. foreign policy. But in recent years, a bipartisan coalition has finally started to question this conventional wisdom. With the United States withdrawing from Afghanistan and ending thirteen years of war, there is no better time to re-examine the tenets of our military strategy. Base Nation is an essential contribution to that debate.",$13.38,4.0

MacDevitt",El Paso Norte Press," This complete edition of Caesar's Commentaries contains all eight of Caesar's books on the Gallic War as well as all three of his books on the Civil War masterfully translated into English by W. A. MacDevitt. Caesar's Commentaries are an outstanding account of extraordinary events by one of the most exceptional men in the history of the world. Julius Caesar himself was one of the most eminent writers of the age in which he lived. His commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars are written with a purity, precision, and perspicuity, which command approbation. They are elegant without affectation, and beautiful without ornament. Of the two books which he composed on Analogy, and those under the title of Anti-Cato, scarcely any fragment is preserved; but we may be assured of the justness of the observations on language, which were made by an author so much distinguished by the excellence of his own compositions. His poem entitled The Journey, which was probably an entertaining narrative, is likewise totally lost. All of Caesar's works that remain intact are contained in this edition of his commentaries. It is to the honor of Caesar, that when he had obtained the supreme power, he exercised it with a degree of moderation beyond what was generally expected by those who had fought on the side of the Republic. His time was almost entirely occupied with public affairs, in the management of which, though he employed many agents, he appears to have had none in the character of actual minister. Caesar deprecated a lingering death, and wished that his own might be sudden and speedy. And the day before he died, the conversation at supper, in the house of Marcus Lepidus, turning upon what was the most eligible way of dying, he gave his opinion in favor of a death that is sudden and unexpected. He died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and was ranked amongst the Gods.",$16.50,4.1

There is almost nothing they will not try. Some embark on multi-million dollar building campaigns while others sell their buildings to plant home churches. Some hire celebrity pastors to attract crowds of people, while others hire no clergy so that there can be open sharing in the service.Yet despite everything churches have tried, few focus much time, money, or energy on the one thing that churches are supposed to be doing: loving and serving others like Jesus.Put Service Back into the Church Service challenges readers to follow a few simple principles and put a few ideas into practice which will help churches of all types and sizes make serving others the primary emphasis of a church service.For books by Jeremy Myers on a similar theme, you may also want to read Skeleton Church and The Death and Resurrection of the Church.",$9.99,5.0

Preia controlul asupra vietii tale” cuprinde în sapte capitole diverse situatii de viata si ipostaze în care ne regasim cu totii la un moment dat din viata noastra. Fie pentru ca nu ne cunoastem suficient de bine, pentru ca nu ne dam voie sa visam si sa „zburam”, pentru ca tinem cont mult prea mult de ce îsi doresc altii si mult prea putin de ce ne dorim noi, sau fie pentru ca înca nu stim cum sa ne accesam resurele si puterea interioara, putem face alegeri care sa nu fie în acord cu autenticitatea noastra, cu dorintele noastre reale si cu misiunea noastra personala. Aceste alegeri ne pot îndeparta de calea noastra si putem ajunge sa experimentam foarte frecvent sentimente negative precum tristete, anxietate, depresie, lipsa de sens, gol interior ori chiar boli fizice.Scopul acestei carti nu este sa îti ofere solutii magice în sapte pasi ci sa te ajute sa îti constientizezi si sa îti accesezi puterea interioara, folosind-o cat mai întelept cu putinta; sa privesti problemele cu care te confrunti din mai multe unghiuri de vedere sau, pur si simplu, pentru un moment, dintr-o alta perspectiva pentru a-ti da voie sa observi cai alternative, mai simple, de solutionare.În urma experientei mele ca psihoterapeut si life-coach am observat care sunt situatiile problematice si blocajele cel mai des întalnite în viata unui om si am hotarat sa tratez aceste situatii în cele sapte capitole ale acestei carti: Stapaneste-ti mintea si emotiileAi încredere în tine si fii autenticFoloseste-ti puterea interioaraÎmbratiseaza viata si schimbareaRespecta-i pe cei din jurAlege întelept oamenii cu care te înconjori Fericirea ta depinde de tine Stiu ca orice om are în interiorul sau toate resursele necesare pentru a face fata dificultatilor vietii, tot ceea ce trebuie sa faca este sa îsi regaseasca calea spre sine, sa îsi redobandeasca puterea interioara si sa îsi ia viata în propriile maini adoptand o gandire sanatoasa, rationala si constructiva.",$22.00,5.0

59113,1483587665,book,paperback,"Faith On a Stone Foundation: Free Will, Morality and the God of Abraham",Stephan Grozinger,BookBaby," Christianity appears to be in sharp decline. Between 2007 and 2014, the number of adults in the United States who consider themselves Christian dropped from 78% to 70%. For two millennia, despite many profound challenges, Christianity experienced nothing but exponential growth. Now, in the last decade, Christians are simply walking away from religious affiliation. What is going on? Will faith inevitably decline? Will our understanding of God become secularized until He is nothing but a metaphor for what is good and noble in humanity? Author Stephan Grozinger argues that faith’s best years are still ahead of it. He explores recent advances in science and philosophy regarding the question of whether human beings have free will and concludes that we do not. But far from being a source of anxiety or even a death sentence for faith, this idea may be the instrument of its renewal. Grozinger describes how, in its earliest years, Christianity came under the thrall of Platonism, which offered some proofs of God’s existence, but at a heavy price. The influence of Plato created a hybrid vision of God: the unconditionally loving God of Scripture and an immovable god, the very Form of Good, who commands, tests, rewards and punishes. The same powerful evolutionary forces that shaped our bodies and minds seduced us into thinking these two contradictory visions could be reconciled. Christianity became a religion that encouraged good, socially useful behavior and turned itself into a scold. Unable to embrace the conclusions of science and philosophy regarding free will, popular-culture faith was left behind and often insults our intelligence and offends our moral sensibilities. But faith’s original message is still compelling. By setting aside Plato’s influence, a more ancient vision of God and our relationship to Him emerges. Unlike a Platonic god, the Scriptural God is not dependent on free will. Grozinger reviews familiar Bible stories such as The Garden, The Flood, Exodus, Jonah, and Job, and invites the reader to see them through new eyes to reveal a God who transcends good and useful behavior. He re-examines the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus in light of this new way of seeing the divine. As the story progresses, Grozinger challenges the assumptions of the New Atheists and offers a competing moral vision. Finally, the book closes with an examination of organized religion and how this new vision of faith is expressed in community.",$18.37,5.0

59224,446504130,book,paperback,NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children,Po Bronson,Twelve," One of the most influential books about children ever published, Nurture Shock offers a revolutionary new perspective on children that upends a library's worth of conventional wisdom. With impeccable storytelling and razor-sharp analysis, the authors demonstrate that many of modern society's strategies for nurturing children are in fact backfiring--because key twists in the science have been overlooked. Nothing like a parenting manual, NurtureShock gets to the core of how we grow, learn and live.Released in hardcover in September 2009, Nurture Shock remained on the New York Times best seller list for three months, and was one of Amazon's best selling books for 2009. The book has become a worldwide phenomenon with editions published around the world - in fifteen languages, to date. In addition to Bronson and Merryman's writings on praise -- first made famous in New York magazine -- there are nine more equally groundbreaking chapters. Among the topics covered:Why the most brutal person in a child's life is often a sibling, and how a single aspect of their preschool-aged play can determine their relationship as adults.When is it too soon - or too late - to teach a child about race? Children in diverse schools are less likely to have a cross-racial friendship, not more - so is school diversity backfiring?Millions of families are fighting to get their kids into private schools and advanced programs as early as possible. But schools are missing the best kids, 73% of the time - the new neuroscience explains why.Why are kids - even those from the best of homes - still aggressive and cruel? The answer is found in a rethinking of parental conflict, discipline, television's unexpected influence, and social dominance.Parents are desperate to jump-start infants' language skills. Recently, scientists have discovered a series of natural techniques that are astonishing in their efficacy - it's not baby videos, sign language, or even the richness of language exposure. It's nothing you've heard before.",$12.72,4.6

A dynamic artist at the height of his poetic powers, Tadić presents to the reader a world that is at once surreal and hauntingly familiar, a world of outlandish encounters and uncanny creatures. His poetry addresses the challenges of surviving as an artist in a Communist society, and themes of victimization, oppression and spiritual pollution permeate much of his work. ASSEMBLY is a gently subversive and mischievous collection, a harrowing yet humanizing work that is a stunning testimony to Tadić's outstanding abilities as an artist.",$10.65,

Rejoining the Question Marks motorcycle club, he discovers that the outlaw world has changed radically in his absence. The Marks have spread across the United States and battles for territory and zealous law enforcement persecution have become part of club life. Jack soon finds that he has left one war behind, only to place himself in the middle of another. Haunted by a league of lost souls he dispatched in that faraway land, he seeks peace for himself and the club. But local law enforcement, secretive federal officials, and even his own club brothers conspire against his efforts and endanger both his leadership and his life. Ultimately he ll have to decide between leading an unwilling club down the long, hard road to peace, or giving in to his demons and destroying everything in his path.",$15.00,4.7

But when one of the humpback whales turns up dragging a mass of fishing gear from its tail, the tour takes a dark turn. It turns darker still when the schooner's handsome captain winds up attached to the vessel's anchor, sixty feet underwater... and not by accident.  Before long, the tour naturalist (and Natalie's best friend's beau) is behind bars, charged with a murder Charlene swears he didn't commit. Stir in a surprise visit from Natalie's quarrelsome sister, midnight kitchen sabotage, a sick orphan kitten, and a mysterious investor with plans for a massive resort on the quaint island, and Natalie's got a recipe for potential disaster. When a second body turns up just outside the inn, the heat is on Natalie to solve the double murder... or risk ending up with her own goose cooked. ",$11.98,4.6

The Northwest region entered an arid phase, and erosion coupled with tectonic events played havoc with river courses. One of them disappeared. Celebrated as Sarasvati in the Rig Veda and the Mahabharata, this river was rediscovered in the early nineteenth century through topographic explorations by British officials. Recently, geological and climatological studies have probed its evolution and disappearance, while satellite imagery has traced the river s buried courses and isotope analyses have dated ancient waters still stored under the Thar Desert. In the same Northwest, the subcontinent s first urban society the Indus civilization flourished and declined. But it was not watered by the Indus alone: since Aurel Stein s expedition in the 1940s, hundreds of Harappan sites have been identified in the now dry Sarasvati s basin. The rich Harappan legacy in technologies, arts and culture sowed the seeds of Indian civilization as we know it now. Drawing from recent research in a wide range of disciplines, this book discusses differing viewpoints and proposes a harmonious synthesis a fascinating tale of exploration that brings to life the vital role the lost river of the Indian desert played before its waters gurgled to a stop.",$8.30,4.8

Trials and tribulations are many, both in her personal relationships and the challenges faced when seeking employment. Her survival instinct is to be greatly admired and she presents a role model to those who are suffering the same learning difficulties. Dolan allows us to follow her life story and share the complex hurdles that she has had to overcome. Rejection and failure at many of the opportunities that she saw as her vocation, from menial tasks to cleaning, only served to fuel her extraordinary persistence that she would, in time, succeed. Now a very successful business woman, born from true grit and determination, she has evolved several successful businesses. Along with her personal struggle, Dolan enjoys her children and husband and integrates them with her role in business.",$13.99,5.0

The good news about endgames is that there are relatively few endings you should know by heart and that once you know these endings, that's it. Your knowledge never goes out of date!The bad news is that, all the same, the endgame technique of most players is deficient. Modern time-controls make matters worse: there is simply not enough time to delve deep into the position.Grandmaster Jesus de la Villa debunks the myth that endgame theory is complex and he teaches you to steer the game into a position you are familiar with. This book contains only those endgames that show up most frequently, are easy to learn and contain ideas that are useful in more difficult positions.Your performance will improve dramatically because this book brings you simple rules, detailed and lively explanations, many diagrams, clear summaries of the most important themes and dozens of tests.",$16.96,4.4

59888,1503951987,book,paperback,Stumbling Into Love (Fluke My Life),Aurora Rose Reynolds,Montlake Romance," From a New York Times and USA Today bestselling author comes an unexpected romance about trying to resist the irresistible…Mackenzie Reed has officially been stood up. Not only has she wasted two years on Mr. So Not Interested but now she doesn’t even have pizza and the Mets to keep her company. Then he walks into her life—more than six feet of rugged, hot stranger. Maybe, just for tonight, Mac can pretend to be a girl she’s not. After all, she deserves a little no-strings fun…As far as Wesley Porter is concerned, one night with Mackenzie isn’t nearly enough. She’s a mystery he wants to solve—if he can keep her from running for the door every time they touch. There’s obviously some serious chemistry between them, so why is she fighting it?As one sexy hookup turns into another (and another), Wesley is determined to prove they were made for each other. But Mac has been hurt before, and she refuses to fall for this sexy, ridiculously perfect guy. In fact, she has every intention of fighting it…unless he can convince her otherwise.",$9.17,4.5

It is about providing guidance, which involves a mix of praise as well as criticism, delivered to produce better results and help employees develop their skills and boundaries of success. Great bosses have a strong relationship with their employees, and Kim Scott has identified three simple principles for building better relationships with your employees: make it personal, get stuff done, and understand why it matters. Radical Candor offers a guide to those bewildered or exhausted by management, written for bosses and those who manage bosses. Drawing on years of first-hand experience, and distilled clearly to give actionable lessons to the reader, Radical Candor shows how to be successful while retaining your integrity and humanity. Radical Candor is the perfect handbook for those who are looking to find meaning in their job and create an environment where people both love their work, their colleagues and are motivated to strive to ever greater success.",$25.13,4.5

It was the hardest interview process she's ever been through, but it all boiled down to one thing: her fertility. Now everything she eats and does is strictly monitored as she lives in isolated splendor on the Westland estate. Stephen Westland started an orphan and became a self made man. But the Billionaire is missing one thing: a family. He has no time or interest in romance or a woman to have a child with, so he does the next best thing: he hires one. Stephen ignores Kendra on the days between her cycle but when the doctor says she is ovulating, he spends every waking moment filling her with his seed. Can he ignore the feelings the young beauty stirs in him? Or the fact that he starts to pray that it takes longer to accomplish their task?",$5.99,3.3

Hayek, Ronald Hamowy",University Of Chicago Press," From the $700 billion bailout of the banking industry to president Barack Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package to the highly controversial passage of federal health-care reform, conservatives and concerned citizens alike have grown increasingly fearful of big government. Enter Nobel Prize–winning economist and political theorist F. A. Hayek, whose passionate warning against empowering states with greater economic control, The Road to Serfdom, became an overnight sensation last summer when it was endorsed by Glenn Beck. The book has since sold over 150,000 copies.The latest entry in the University of Chicago Press’s series of newly edited editions of Hayek’s works, The Constitution of Liberty is, like Serfdom, just as relevant to our present moment. The book is considered Hayek’s classic statement on the ideals of freedom and liberty, ideals that he believes have guided—and must continue to guide—the growth of Western civilization. Here Hayek defends the principles of a free society, casting a skeptical eye on the growth of the welfare state and examining the challenges to freedom posed by an ever expanding government—as well as its corrosive effect on the creation, preservation, and utilization of knowledge. In opposition to those who call for the state to play a greater role in society, Hayek puts forward a nuanced argument for prudence. Guided by this quality, he elegantly demonstrates that a free market system in a democratic polity—under the rule of law and with strong constitutional protections of individual rights—represents the best chance for the continuing existence of liberty.           Striking a balance between skepticism and hope, Hayek’s profound insights are timelier and more welcome than ever before. This definitive edition of The Constitution of Liberty will give a new generation the opportunity to learn from his enduring wisdom. ",$22.15,4.6

By all appearances, the Cavanaughs of West Palm have an ideal marriage and family life - the perfect home with few complications.   But castles built on sand are eventually washed away by the sea.   Meet...   Leslie Cavanaugh â sheâs not the woman she claims to be. Once Leslie Phillips, she's hiding a painful secret that's about to shake her family to its core.   Luke Cavanaugh â Leslieâs second husband, but he looks eerily like her first. An award-winning architect, Lukeâs got designs on getting to the bottom of his wifeâs past...in more ways than one.   Kathryn Cavanaugh â Luke and Leslieâs only daughter. In competition for her motherâs affection, Katie risks much more than the familyâs good name with exploits of all the wrong places...   Dawn Chadwick â Leslieâs only friend and sister in widowhood. What would Leslie have done without Dawn all these years? And what would Luke?   Grace Cunningham â abandoned at birth...and pissed about it. What makes a mother abandon her child, not once, but twice in a lifetime?   Meanwhile, a mysterious couple secretly rendezvous in a Palm Beach bungalow...   In this steamy saga of lost love, marriage and motherhood, hidden secrets and shocking truths collide as Leslie Cavanaughâs past rocks the present in the most intimate betrayal of all.   THE GREAT BETRAYAL will keep you up all night.",$16.00,4.1

Baxley,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," Dana Darcy is a Southern Gothic tale of Pride and Prejudice set in London, England and Charleston, South Carolina. It is told in two parts.Part One begins in London where Fitzwilliam Darcy and his wife, the former Elizabeth Bennett of Tennessee, discover a lost and lonely child who bears a strong resemblance to Fitzwilliam's mother, Anne Darcy.Two months before his marriage in The Cumberland Plateau, David Darcy, in an attempt to forget Cecilia Lawton, the woman who held claim to his heart, had one last encounter with his long time lover Sandra Hamilton. But when he realized Sandra was in love with him, he broke off their relationship never to return again. Seven years have passed and once again Sandra Hamilton will reenter his life, this time with a little girl. As Sandra lies dying, will David come, and more importantly, will he love and accept the daughter he never knew existed? Part Two of Dana Darcy opens in Charleston, set in the rich culture and tradition of the Gullah People, former slaves of the rice and cotton planters on the Sea Islands and Coastal Plains of South Carolina and Georgia. Against the will of those who tried to conquer them, they have held to their ways...ways little understood and greatly feared by many.An old family curse has haunted the Lawton Family of the Carolina Lowcounry since 1820. With her marriage to David and the subsequent birth of their three sons, Cecilia believes the curse to be broken. But is it really, and more importantly, who placed the curse and why?As the story begins to unravel, an aging Root Doctor, Peter Morgan, finds himself pressed back into service as he tries to learn the truth about the strange happenings within the family he loves and works for. A snake, a cat, and a blood rose, what do they mean?The Cumberland Plateau continues as David Darcy must face his earlier mistakes and reconcile his past with the present in order break the curse and come to love the little girl that calls him Daddy.This novel is a classic Southern Gothic tale. It contains Christian elements with Spiritual Warfare and some violence but is not sexual in content. Although this is the second book in a series, it is a stand alone work.Rated PG13.",$19.52,4.4

Parnell.,FriesenPress," Born in London, England in 1922, Anthony Parnell's interest in aeroplanes took hold of his imagination at an early age. He became a plane spotter with his friend at Croydon Aerodrome. As his love grew, his dream was that one day he would fly. Becoming a pilot in the RAF fulfilled that dream. On March 28, 1942 leaving at dawn on a Top Secret Mission, Anthony's flight came to an abrupt end when he made an emergency landing with his crippled plane on a beach he believed was on the English coast. He and his crew were taken prisoner and thus began his WWII experience as a Prisoner Of War in Stalag V111B. This book tells the story of Anthony's experience during that suspenseful and hopeless time, including his attempts at escape and the 1,000 kilometres walk across Europe in winter conditions that would later become known as The Death March.  Per Ardua ad Astra - Through Adversity to the Stars - that is the RAF Motto, and the motto that Anthony Parnell would attempt to follow in his struggle for survival....",$15.49,

Westlake, one of the greats of crime fiction, wrote twenty-four fast-paced, hard-boiled novels featuring Parker, a shrewd career criminal with a talent for heists and a code all his own. With the publication of the last four Parker novels Westlake wrote—Breakout, Nobody Runs Forever, Ask the Parrot, and Dirty Money—the University of Chicago Press pulls the ultimate score: for the first time ever, the entire Parker series will be available from a single publisher. With Parker locked up and about to be unmasked, Breakout follows his Houdini-like escape from prison with a team of convicts. But when a new heist and new dangers—con artists, snitches, busybodies, eccentrics, and cops—loom among the dark alleys and old stone buildings of the big city to which they’ve fled, Parker soon learns that not all prisons have bars. Featuring new forewords by Chris Holm, Duane Swierczynski, and Laura Lippman—celebrated crime writers, all—these masterworks of noir are the capstone to an extraordinary literary run that will leave you craving more. Written over the course of fifty years, the Parker novels are pure artistry, adrenaline, and logic both brutal and brilliant. Join Parker on his jobs and read them all again or for the first time. But don’t talk to the law.",$13.00,4.2

Brown,Tate Publishing,"            This is a sentimental story about a young man, injured in the View Nam War, who returns to Dallas, Texas, in 1965, and begins rebuilding his life. Set against the rock and roll era of the 60's, when casual sex and recreational drugs were the norm, two brothers who were separated from their mother at a young age, are reunited only to find that their upbringing on opposite sides of the tracts puts a deep wedge between their relationship.             Returning from a VA hospital in Louisiana, twenty-four year old Carson Chance stops on the interstate to pick up a beautiful seventeen year old female hitch hiker named Amy Warren.                         A private investigator, Carson offers Amy, a chance to get back on her feet, until he finds she is wanted for murder. Angry and distraught, Carson sets out to prove her innocent.            Longing to be in a relationship with Carson after her release, she returns to prove she has grown into a woman but Carson pushes her away feeling that she needs someone closer to her own age.  Determined to show Carson he is wrong, she attends college and then becomes a motorcycle cop in Carson's own neighborhood and often stops by his house to tantalize him. The sparks are ignited and Carson's life will never be the same.             Carson's own life is threatened when a member of the Chicago mafia tries to hire him to find someone for them. When Carson refuses they use Amy to blackmail him into helping them.  Carson barely escapes death again, and his addition to drugs puts him over the edge and drives a deep wedge between him and Amy, his one true love. Like two pages torn from the same book their ragged edges fit together perfectly, only he doesn't know it.          ",,4.6

60940,870340581,book,paperback,Reminiscences of a Stock Operator,Lefevre Edwin,Fraser Publishing Company," 299 pages. Reminiscences of a Stock Operator is adapted from a series of Saturday Evening Post articles written by Edwin Lefevre in the 1920s. The book narrates Livermore's ascent from a ""boy plunger"" to the most influential speculator on Wall Street. While much of the book is devoted to Livermore's experiences, a larger part of the book deals with trading wisdom and rules that Livermore imparts through Lefevre. Years later, many trading and investing books repeat the very same rules first enunciated by Livermore in Reminiscences, such as: go with the trend; no stock is too high to buy or too low to sell; let your winners run and cut your losses short; make your own decisions; and market history repeats itself. Interestingly, Livermore frequently violated his own rules and usually lost money as a result. The enduring appeal to the book rests in Livermore's view that the market is made up of people and the excesses of the market reflect mass psychology and the mistakes of individuals are frequently the result of the inability to control fear and greed. Thus, the views and lessons of Livermore continue to be relevant to every new generation of investors and traders. Generations of investors have benefited from this 1923 masterpiece. Jack Schwager's new introduction explains why this account of Jesse Livermore, one of the greatest speculators ever-continues to be the most widely read book by the trading community.

61007,1986671054,book,paperback,Strategy Pure and Simple: Essential Moves for Winning in Competition and Cooperation,William J. Bahr,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," This new book unveils powerful moves to win most anytime, anywhere. Includes many new, highly effective ways to win easily and ethically, in competition and cooperation. Useful in politics, business, war, sports, and games. Written by a successful corporate director and West Pointer. Makes protecting yourself much easier! The essence of winning can be distilled from principles common to all successful human action. Of many actions open for examination, two are highly important: competition and cooperation. Studying competition yields insights on winning in fights for rights or interests. Studying cooperation brings skill at winning in groups with shared goals. To cover these subjects, you can read the books of master theorists from Sun Tzu, through Machiavelli and Clausewitz, to Drucker and Deming. You can also read about master practitioners from Ulysses, through Napoleon and Lee, to modern-day captains of industry and esteemed statesmen. To aid you in such effort, this ""philosophy of strategy"" tries to consolidate, integrate, and improve upon the works of these master strategists. Distilling the essence of competition and cooperation, it reveals the universal rules of winning, those simple yet critical formulas which change a situation to your advantage. In doing so, it crystallizes the powerful methods of attack and defense for your use in virtually any application, whether it be in general life, business, games, sports, politics, martial arts, or war. By presenting strategic action from such a high-level vantage point, this book helps change strategy from an art to a science. In doing so, it provides almost any interested student with the pure power of strategy. Because the development of strategies often means developing better options, the author includes as a supplement his handy new idea generator: “Instant Productivity: 101 Ways to Create.”",$6.95,

To survive and thrive in this new world, organizations require an increased focus on hiring, training and retaining the leadership talent best equipped to succeed. Along with scholarly research on leadership, The Parker Principles incorporates a unique leadership mosaic of personal experiences and learnings from a dynamic array of sources: West Point, U.S. Army Rangers, Combat and some of the best organizations in the corporate world. Every organization has a growing list of needs to succeed: a powerful culture, talent retention, organizational engagement and increased productivity, innovation, resiliency, revenue and profits. Irrelevant of an organizations’ needs, 99% of them can be achieved through great leadership. Great leadership is the single most powerful and enduring competitive advantage. The Parker Principles is about sharing great leadership lessons and best practices that I wish someone would have shared with me decades ago. I present you with proven business and “combat” tested information. The information is hard hitting, transparent and direct – successes and failures. The best practices are practical and immediately actionable. If you internalize the information and incorporate the best practices in The Parker Principles, I guarantee you will be a better leader, maybe even a great leader. Whatever your leadership level, you will be more successful, effective and productive while earning more trust, respect and admiration. Let’s get to work. Rangers lead the Way!",$20.58,4.6

His raw and experimental work lays bare the unimportance of our world and the sickening madness of the human condition. Like the greatest writers of cosmic horror, Ligotti bends reality until it cracks, opening fissures through which he invites us to gaze on the unsettling darkness of the abyss below.For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,500 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.",$14.45,4.1

Eliot PrizeA New York Times Top 10 Book of 2016""There is a powerful emotional undertow to these poems that springs from Mr. Vuong's sincerity and candor, and from his ability to capture specific moments in time with both photographic clarity and a sense of the evanescence of all earthly things.""--Michiko Kakutani, The New York TimesLibrary Journal 2016 Best Books of the Year WINNER, 2016 Whiting AwardWINNER, 2017 Publishing Triangle's Thom Gunn AwardFINALIST, 2017 Kate Tufts Discovery AwardFINALIST, 2017 Lambda Literary Award In his haunting and fearless debut, Ocean Vuong walks a tightrope of historic and personal violences, creating an interrogation of the American body as a borderless space of both failure and triumph. At once vulnerable and redemptive, dreamlike and visceral, compassionate and unforgiving, these poems seek a myriad existence without forgetting the prerequisite of self-preservation in a world bent on extinguishing its othered voices. Vuong's poems show, through breath, cadence, and unrepentant enthrallment, that a gentle palm on a chest can calm the most necessary of hungers.Praise for Ocean Vuong:""Reading Vuong is like watching a fish move: he manages the varied currents of English with muscled intuition....His lines are both long and short, his pose narrative and lyric, his diction formal and insouciant. From the outside, Vuong has fashioned a poetry of inclusion.""--The New Yorker""[A] masterpiece that captures, with elegance, the raw sorrows and joys of human existence."" --Buzzfeed Books""An important new voice in American poetry.""--Beloit Poetry Journal""What a treasure [Ocean Vuong] is to us. What a perfume he's crushed and rendered of his heart and soul. What a gift this book is."" --Li-Young Lee""[Vuong] takes from Pound the ability to eternalize a moment.""  --POETRY ""Even as Vuong leads you through every pleasure a body deserves and all the ensuing grief, these poems restore you with hope, that godforsaken thing--alive, singing along to the radio, suddenly sufficient.""--Traci Brimhall ""What this poet sees on the street, in a blizzard, or even while studying an apple reminds me of those dreams we have in common: dreams in which we are falling but never touch the ground, dreams in which we are naked in the presence of men suited for our ruin.""--Jericho Brown",$10.87,4.6

Counseling And Many Other Anger Techniques",David S. Perry,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," What is your anger all about? Is it unrestrained? Does it pose a threat to you and to other people? This is the very first thing you need to do: Ask yourself the critical question of whether you present a threat to yourself or to those around you when your anger finds you. If your reply is yes, then you need to look for professional help from an anger management counselor sooner than later. Do so before you injure your life and perhaps somebody else’s. Anger is a basic human emotion and a natural response to situations beyond our control. Everybody has likely felt anger at one time or another. While particular individuals get angry more often than others and have regular, intense outbursts, others tend to bottle their feelings and then blow up or flare up without warning. Depending upon how it's dealt with and expressed, anger may be favorable or damaging. It has favorable effects when angry feelings help you address an issue with yourself or a different individual and correct the situation. On the other hand, unrestrained anger leads to assorted unhealthy behaviors like violence and aggression. When anger interferes with your power to think or act clearly, this may cause you unnecessary trouble. Admitting that you have a personality that is prone to anger and then realizing the need to actively work towards anger management in order to live a more pleasant life, makes all the difference in dealing with anger successfully.",$8.95,

After 99% of the population of the planet is killed in less than 24 hours, for the very few who have managed to stay alive, things are about to get much worse. Animated by ""phase two"" of some unknown contagion, the dead begin to rise. At first slow, blind, dumb and lumbering, quickly the bodies regain their most basic senses and abilities... sight, hearing, locomotion... As well as the instinct toward aggression and violence. Held back only by the restraints of their rapidly decomposing flesh, the dead seem to have only one single goal - to lumber forth and destroy the sole remaining attraction in the silent, lifeless world: those who have survived the plague, who now find themselves outnumbered 1,000,000 to 1...Without ever using the 'Z' word, Autumn offers a new perspective on the traditional zombie story. There's no flesh eating, no fast-moving corpses, no gore for gore's sake. Combining the atmosphere and tone of George Romero's classic living dead films with the attitude and awareness of 28 Days (and Weeks) later, this horrifying and suspenseful novel is filled with relentless cold, dark fear.",$16.68,3.7

The story is beloved around the world as a tale about personal transformation for the better. “The Ugly Duckling” was first published in Copenhagen, Denmark to great critical acclaim.

Hebert,Morgan James Publishing," What do we already know about kids?ALL kids are naturally curious.ALL kids want attention.When we make time to Show, Ask, or Teach kids something, we help kids in two very important ways:-We help them grow smarter. Consequently, they will know more and want to know more.-We give them our time and undivided attention. Consequently, they will grow appreciative and grateful for our efforts, and connect with us more as parents.The Teachable Minute raises one very important question in today’s fast-paced, technologically advanced world:How can we strike a balance between engaging with devices and interacting with kids?“As I considered the answer, I drew from my many years of experience as a mother of three children, experienced educator, and national literacy consultant. I’ve caught thousands, if not millions, of ‘teachable minutes’ with kids! What I know for sure is that when we make a conscious effort to capture ‘the teachable minute’ as often as possible, in a variety of settings, we help kids grow smarter and more appreciative.”—from the book The Teachable MinuteThe teachable minute is a golden opportunity to teach kids something, anywhere, FAST. It can be caught at any time, in common places where we all live and go. The teachable minute can appear in a car, at the mall, around the kitchen table, at the post office, in the yard, on a plane, in an elevator, at the beach, on the subway, in a rocking chair, at the park, in the bathtub, and anywhere else you can think of.Dr. Connie Hebert is a nationally acclaimed teacher of teachers, author, motivational speaker, and mother. She wants all parents to experience the teachable minute—because when it’s gone, it’s gone. Catch it with your kids. The Teachable Minute shows you how!For more information on how to capture the teachable minute with your kids, please visit: www.theteachableminute.com OR www.conniehebert.com",$14.95,4.8

61371,1785783998,book,paperback,Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money,David Orrell,Icon Books," A decade after the financial crisis, there is a growing consensus that economics has failed and needs to go back to the drawing board. David Orrell argues that it has been trying to solve the wrong problem all along. Economics sees itself as the science of scarcity. Instead, it should be the science of money (which plays a surprisingly small role in mainstream theory). And money is a substance that turns out to have a quantum nature of its own. Just as physicists learn about matter by studying the exchange of particles at the subatomic level, so economics should begin by analysing the nature of money-based transactions. Quantum Economics therefore starts with the meaning of the phrase ‘how much’ - or, to use the Latin word, quantum. From quantum physics to the dualistic properties of money, via the emerging areas of quantum finance and quantum cognition, this profoundly important book reveals that quantum economics is to neoclassical economics what quantum physics is to classical physics - a genuine turning point in our understanding.

Smith, Doc Searls",Happy About," The convergence of technology that accelerates the power of relationships and facilitates dynamic communications-- peer to peer and to entire communities--is revolutionary to say the least. The book examines the factors that are influencing the emergence of The Relationship Economy.  The book defines The Relationship Economy as: ""The people and things we are connected with in our personal networks who or that distribute or consume our capital, which in turn influences our individual production outputs."" The book analyzes the factors that are influencing an emerging economy based on the sum of factors driving massive and significant changes to the way everyone will work, play, and live.  This emergence will have an especially profound effect on businesses and individuals. While individual factors are self-evident, the collective factors, taken as a whole, are the basis for individual conclusions for strategic opportunities that can be gained from the new economy.  The book provides the knowledge, tools and suggested skills necessary for improved comprehension of the strategic issues required to succeed in The Relationship Economy, and provides the context of actions that enable success. It covers an emerging opportunity for the global community of users/consumers/prosumers/citizens, consumer brands, corporations, non-governmental organizations and governments to play a critical role in forging this new carbon neutral economy: The Relationship Economy.  This book details an emerging economy, driven by factors that are affecting massive changes to the way people work, play, and live. This emergence will have an especially profound effect on business. While individual factors are self-evident, when taken collectively, they are the basis that individuals use to identify strategic opportunities to be gained from the new economy.  Starting with a foreword by Doc Searls, Co-Author of 'The Cluetrain Manifesto', this book is a foundational resource for individuals and entities to use as each begins to plan for participation in the accelerated changes brought on my technological advances of the World Wide Web. The goal of the book is to enable all parties to gain perspectives, knowledge, and insights as to the dynamics of technology, the impact of changes brought on by the social Web, and what factors should be considered for the purposes of planning for success.",$2.96,5.0

61387,1615776311,book,paperback,JFK-9/11: 50 Years of Deep State,Laurent Guyenot,Progressive Press," JFK-9/11 assembles the most significant and well-documented “deep events” of the last fifty years into a coherent narrative of the “deep history” of the United States and its sphere of influence. The result is both a concise introduction for newcomers (a “deep history for dummies”), and an insightful perspective for informed readers. Relying strictly on documented evidence and state-of-the-art JFK and 9/11 research, the book cuts through the layers of government and mainstream media lies, to expose the hidden powers at work in the Empire’s underground foreign policy. It documents the role of undercover and paramilitary operations, psychological warfare and disinformation campaigns, and above all false flag terror, in the course of world politics since the beginning of the Cold War, and increasingly since September 11th. The book is divided in two parts: the first deals with the underlying forces of the Cold War, the second with the driving forces of the War on Terror. The period investigated begins just before November 22, 1963 and peaks on September 11, 2001, the two deep events that weigh most heavily on the unfolding of American and world history. The author highlights their structural similarities, examines how one made the other possible thirty-eight years later, and follows the underlying thread leading from the one to the other, in the hope of anticipating and circumventing future atrocities.",$19.76,4.5

And Miles knew hustling was in his veins."" Miles Morales is just your average teenager. Dinner every Sunday with his parents, chilling out playing old-school video games with his best friend, Ganke, crushing on brainy, beautiful poet Alicia. He's even got a scholarship spot at the prestigious Brooklyn Visions Academy. Oh yeah, and he's Spider Man. But lately, Miles's spidey-sense has been on the fritz. When a misunderstanding leads to his suspension from school, Miles begins to question his abilities. After all, his dad and uncle were Brooklyn jack-boys with criminal records. Maybe kids like Miles aren't meant to be superheroes. Maybe Miles should take his dad's advice and focus on saving himself. As Miles tries to get his school life back on track, he can't shake the vivid nightmares that continue to haunt him. Nor can he avoid the relentless buzz of his spidey-sense every day in history class, amidst his teacher's lectures on the historical benefits of slavery and the modern-day prison system. But after his scholarship is threatened, Miles uncovers a chilling plot, one that puts his friends, his neighborhood, and himself at risk. It's time for Miles to suit up.",$7.40,4.1

Some call it aesthetic destructionFollowing the theft of eight kilos of Highly Enriched Uranium, an ultimatum is issued to the West: Release El Aqrab or a nuclear bomb will be detonated. But, at the last moment, El Aqrab escapes . . . and the authorities never get the bombWhile Homeland Security is convinced it's headed for New York, only Agent Decker - assisted by brilliant and beautiful oceanographer Emily Swenson - believes the bomb's true destination is La Palma, in the Canary Island chain.Now, Decker and Swenson only have six hours to prove their theory, defuse the bomb, and prevent a mega-tsunami from annihilating the Eastern SeaboardKirkus said, ""Sandom's strength lies in the verve of his story, with writing that has both muscle . . . (and) brains . . . (THE WAVE) races from improbable to crazywild, all in good fun, with Sandom always one step ahead . . . A story with enough manic energy to be worthy of a nuclear explosion.""

Journalists flocked to the region to extract sympathetic profiles of families devastated by poverty, abandoned by establishment politics, and eager to consume cheap campaign promises. What You Are Getting Wrong About Appalachia is a frank assessment of America's recent fascination with the people and problems of the region. The book analyzes trends in contemporary writing on Appalachia, presents a brief history of Appalachia with an eye toward unpacking Appalachian stereotypes, and provides examples of writing, art, and policy created by Appalachians as opposed to for Appalachians. The book offers a must-needed insider's perspective on the region.",$11.52,3.8

61726,307720462,book,paperback,Twilight of the Elites: America After Meritocracy,Chris Hayes,Broadway Books," A powerful and original argument that traces the roots of our present crisis of authority to an unlikely source: the meritocracy.Over the past decade, Americans watched in bafflement and rage as one institution after another –  from Wall Street to Congress, the Catholic Church to corporate America, even Major League Baseball – imploded under the weight of corruption and incompetence. In the wake of the Fail Decade, Americans have historically low levels of trust in their institutions; the social contract between ordinary citizens and elites lies in tatters.How did we get here? With Twilight of the Elites, Christopher Hayes offers a radically novel answer. Since the 1960s, as the meritocracy elevated a more diverse group of men and women into power, they learned to embrace the accelerating inequality that had placed them near the very top. Their ascension heightened social distance and spawned a new American elite--one more prone to failure and corruption than any that came before it.Mixing deft political analysis, timely social commentary, and deep historical understanding, Twilight of the Elites describes how the society we have come to inhabit – utterly forgiving at the top and relentlessly punitive at the bottom – produces leaders who are out of touch with the people they have been trusted to govern. Hayes argues that the public's failure to trust the federal government, corporate America, and the media has led to a crisis of authority that threatens to engulf not just our politics but our day-to-day lives.Upending well-worn ideological and partisan categories, Hayes entirely reorients our perspective on our times. Twilight of the Elites is the defining work of social criticism for the post-bailout age.",$12.00,4.4

A debut thriller for fans of John Le Carré and Stella Rimington. Prague 2015. Herbert Biely, aged hero of the Prague Spring, stands on the brink of an historic victory, poised to reunite the Czech and Slovak Republics 26 years after the Velvet Revolution. The imminent Czech elections are the final stage in realizing his dream of reunification, but other parties have their own agendas and plans for the fate of the region. A shadowy collective, masked as an innocuous European Union Institute, will do anything to preserve the status quo. Institute operative Peter Lowe’s mission is to prevent reunification by the most drastic of measures. Yet Peter is not all that he seems—a deeply troubled man, desperate to escape the past, his resentment towards himself, his assignment, and his superiors deepens as he questions not just the cause, but his growing feelings for the mission target. As alliances shift and the election countdown begins, Prague becomes the focal point for intrigue on an international scale. The body count rises, options fade, and Peter’s path to redemption is clouded in a maelstrom of love, deception, and murder—can he confront his past to save the future?",$12.19,4.8

The new cinema? The apotheosis of art and entertainment, the realization of Wagnerian gesamtkunstwerk? The final victory of interaction over passivity? No, probably not. Games are part art and part appliance, part tableau and part toaster. In How to Talk about Videogames, leading critic Ian Bogost explores this paradox more thoroughly than any other author to date.Delving into popular, familiar games like Flappy Bird, Mirror’s Edge, Mario Kart, Scribblenauts, Ms. Pac-Man, FarmVille, Candy Crush Saga, Bully, Medal of Honor, Madden NFL, and more, Bogost posits that videogames are as much like appliances as they are like art and media. We don’t watch or read games like we do films and novels and paintings, nor do we perform them like we might dance or play football or Frisbee. Rather, we do something in-between with games. Games are devices we operate, so game critique is both serious cultural currency and self-parody. It is about figuring out what it means that a game works the way it does and then treating the way it works as if it were reasonable, when we know it isn’t.Noting that the term games criticism once struck him as preposterous, Bogost observes that the idea, taken too seriously, risks balkanizing games writing from the rest of culture, severing it from the “rivers and fields” that sustain it. As essential as it is, he calls for its pursuit to unfold in this spirit: “God save us from a future of games critics, gnawing on scraps like the zombies that fester in our objects of study.”",$17.95,4.2

Life in Singapore is good for Swiss private banker Richard Lardelli, and business is booming. That is until he uncovers a key client’s suspected criminal involvement with rainforest depletion, money laundering, and human trafficking. Richard is told by his superior to keep quiet. Richard’s choice: to choose between his career or to follow his conscience.  Richard’s choice leads to a dangerous and enigmatic journey into the unknown. The Quiet Ang Moh follows Richard as he tries to figure out how to confront the demons of his past, and survive long enough to make things right. Help arrives unexpectedly from powerful and eccentric benefactors, who have been waiting for this very moment. Richard can also count on his eclectic friends for help. More than simply a thrilling international adventure with plenty of dark twists and turns, this story draws on the history of Asia, its culture, and its people, and delves into the psychology of what makes humans tick. As inspiring as intriguing, The Quiet Ang Moh is ultimately an unforgettable story of friendship, love, hope, growth, and fortitude.",$14.99,4.4

Now in English, Alsanea’s tale of the personal struggles of four young upper-class women offers Westerners an unprecedented glimpse into a society often veiled from view. Living in restrictive Riyadh but traveling all over the globe, these modern Saudi women literally and figuratively shed traditional garb as they search for love, fulfillment, and their place somewhere in between Western society and their Islamic home.",$12.13,3.9

Authors Steve Alcorn and David Green were there, as employees of Disney's WED Imagineering. ""Building a Better Mouse"" tells the tale of the ""hundreds of mostly young, mostly bright and all embarrassingly idealistic people"" who worked on Epcot, and gives a unique insider's perspective on what it was like to be in the trenches as a Disney Imagineer in the early 1980s, from pixie dusting - when new employees are indoctrinated into all things Disney - through the craziness of the engineering design process, right up until the last frantic dash to opening day. It is a breathtaking, breezy, E-ticket ride of a book, required reading for both hard-core Disneyphiles and people interested in the business side of themed entertainment.",$19.95,4.4

In the fall of 2012, she went through a harrowing cycle of panic attacks and dread that wouldn't abate for months. So she began @sosadtoday, an anonymous Twitter feed that allowed her to express her darkest feelings, and which quickly gained a dedicated following. In SO SAD TODAY, Broder delves deeper into the existential themes she explores on Twitter, grappling with sex, death, love low self-esteem, addiction, and the drama of waiting for the universe to text you back.

Gentry's novel isn't primarily about the version of the self that comes from a name and a family of origin; instead, it draws our attention to the self that's forged from sheer survival, and from the clarifying call to vengeance.” —New York Times Book Review Anna’s daughter Julie was kidnapped from her own bedroom when she was thirteen years old, while Anna slept just downstairs, unaware that her daughter was being ripped away from her. For eight years, she has lived with the guilt and the void in her family, hoping against hope that Julie is still alive. And then one night, the doorbell rings. A young woman who appears to be Julie is finally, miraculously, home safe. Anna and the rest of the family are thrilled, but soon Anna begins to see holes in Julie’s story. When she is contacted by a former detective turned private eye, she is forced to wonder if this young woman is even her daughter at all. And if she isn’t Julie, what is it that she wants? “So much about this novel is fresh and insightful and decidedly not like every other thriller . . . Good as Gone ranks as an outstanding debut, well worth reading. This is no mere Gone Girl wannabe.” —Dallas Morning News",$10.12,3.8

As she was taken from me I knew I might never see my daughter again. 37 years later… ‘You were adopted’. Three short words and Sabina’s life fractures. There would forever be a Before those words, and an After. Pregnant with her own child, Sabina can’t understand how a mother could abandon her daughter, or why her parents have kept the past a secret. Determined to find the woman who gave her away, what she discovers will change everything, not just for Sabina, but for the women who have loved her all these years.

The Gospels have been dismissed by Jesus Seminar and other critical scholars as legend or theological spin, and Christians as fools for believing them. In this fascinating work, scholar David Marshall (whose writings have been compared to C. S. Lewis and G. K. Chesterton) shows why the skeptics are wrong, and the Gospels right. Marshall describes a dozen critical errors Jesus skeptics commit. He then analyzes fifty traits that make the Gospels unique and persuasive. Finally, drawing on his study of Asian religions and literature, he surveys ancient myth, biography, and romance, and shows there is nothing quite like the New Testament writings in all the world.",$5.57,2.4

This book addresses the 'mindblindness' of people united in their interest in autism but divided by their different angles and perspectives. Divided into four parts, the book first defines autism, then the views of the three main groups working with it - autistic individuals, parents and professionals - under the headings of classifications, diagnosis, causes, development, theories and treatment. By comparing and reconciling the different perspectives in this way, the book helps each group to understand and predict each other's responses and behaviours.This enlightening and innovative book offers a unique way of 'stepping in each other's shoes' and is a valuable resource for all people living or working with autism.",$32.27,3.2

Not content to be confined to any single region, she guides readers through dark realms of fantasy into the churning industry of steampunk, from the dizzying heights of science fiction down to the most desolate depths of horror. The strength of the tales that make up this quiet cataclysm-for example ""Magdala Amygdala,"" winner of the 2013 Stoker Award for Superior Achievement in Short Fiction-do not compete. Instead they overlap to create a vista of ethical armageddons at once thorny and hopeful. Snyder's irresistible prose and stunning eye for detail bind together a collection that defies expectation but delivers deep satisfaction.",$12.95,4.7

Her father, Bart Denum, turns to his old friend Hugo Marston for help. Marston, the security chief at the American Embassy, makes some inquiries and quickly realizes something is amiss: Bart’s daughter was not a model, but rather a dancer at a seedy strip club. And she headed to Barcelona with some guy she met at the club.With his friend and former CIA agent, Tom Green, Marston heads for Barcelona. The two sleuths identify the man last seen with the girl, break into his house, and encounter a shocking scene: Bart Denum, standing over the dead and battered body of their mysterious stranger. Though Bart protests his innocence, under the damning circumstances, Spanish authorities arrest him for murder. The two American investigators are faced with their biggest challenge ever: find the real killer, prove Bart’s innocence, and locate his missing daughter—without getting killed along the way.",$15.95,4.1

Drawing on linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, anthropology and quantum mechanics, she looks at how the nature of the senses inform an individual's view of the world, and how language both reflects and constructs that view. Examining the 'whys' and 'hows' of the senses, and the role of language, Olga Bogdashina challenges common perceptions of what it means to be 'normal' and 'abnormal'. In doing so she shows that autism can help to illuminate our understanding of what it means to be human, and of how we develop faculties that shape our cognition, language, and behaviour. In the final chapter, she explores phenomena often associated with the paranormal - including premonitions, telepathy and déjà vu - and shows that these can largely be explained in natural terms. This book will appeal to anyone with a personal or professional interest in autism, including students and researchers, clinical practitioners, individuals on the autism spectrum and their families, teachers, speech and occupational therapists, and other professionals.",$19.95,4.5

Obviously there may be readers of this manuscript who are not on-board with us in these arcane studies. These directions are not for this type. And this is where the concept of Resonance comes in quite profoundly. If this material does not Resonate with you on some level, if it does not pique your interest and compel you to read on, it is probably not for you. Resonance, you see. It is at the foundation of all activities in Reality Creation. ~ SETH  In his new book, Seth adds to the material he first covered with Jane Roberts in The Magical Way. First, he offers his interpretation of the Ancient Wisdom material that informs the New Age movement in the arts and sciences. He then describes a method for using his new material to create a spiritual practice of self-discovery. Finally, he explains how the dedicated student can internalize ancient Essential Metaphors and Precepts and go on to create Positive Realities in all of the domains of living. This is a book that takes the Seth material in an exciting new direction. Not to be missed by the serious student of metaphysics.",$20.00,

He shows how curiosity has been the “secret” that fueled his rise as one of Hollywood’s leading producers and creative visionaries, and how all of us can channel its power to lead bigger and more rewarding lives. Grazer has spent most of his life exploring curiosity through what he terms “curiosity conversations” with some of the most interesting people in the world, including spies, royals, scientists, politicians, moguls, Nobel laureates, artists…anyone whose story might broaden his worldview. These discussions sparked the creative inspiration behind many of his movies and TV shows, including Splash, 24, A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, Arrested Development, 8 Mile, J. Edgar, Empire, and many others. A Curious Mind is not only a fascinating page-turner—it also offers a blueprint for how we can awaken our own curiosity and use it as a superpower in our lives. Whether you’re looking to strengthen your management style at work, uncover a new source of creativity, or become a better romantic partner, this book—and its lessons on the power of curiosity—can change your life.",$9.28,3.7

While keeping the political dimensions of the dispute over the territory in focus, these innovative essays branch out from the high politics of the conflict to consider less well-known aspects and areas of Kashmir. They examine the continuities and ruptures between Kashmir's past and its present situation; reevaluate the contemporary political scenario from the perspective of gender, economic and political marginality, everyday experiences, and governance; and analyze the ways in which the region of Kashmir and its people are represented and (re)present themselves in films and literature through their regional and religious identities, and commodities. This volume aims to understand the limitations of postcolonial nationalism and citizenship as exemplified by the situation in contemporary Kashmir.",$24.23,
