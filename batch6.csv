Here schools and churches were completely integrated, blacks and whites intermarried, and power and wealth were shared by both races. But for this to happen, the town’s citizens had to keep secrets, break the laws of the world outside, and sweep aside fear and embrace hope. In a historical-detective feat, Anna-Lisa Cox uncovers the heartening story of this community that took the road untaken. Beginning in the 1860s, the people of Covert, Michigan, attempted to do what then seemed impossible: love one’s neighbor—regardless of skin color—as oneself. Drawing on diaries, oral histories, and contemporary records, Cox gives us intimate glimpses of Covert’s people, from William Conner, the Civil War veteran who went on to become Michigan's first black justice of the peace, to Elizabeth Gillard, who, shipwrecked and washed onto Covert's shores, ultimately came to love the unusual community she would call home. In bringing these and other stories of this small town to light, Cox presents a vision of what our nation might have been, and could be.",$15.69,4.5

So about a year ago, I sat down and wrote what turned out to be the best selling ebook about improving at League of Legends on Amazon - 30 Days to Diamond. I used my experience as a real life teacher and a high elo player to create the most detailed, effective and complete source of game knowledge out there. The impact 30 Days to Diamond had on hundreds of players was enormous and I have summarized the results they achieved in the preface of this book. The book made a bold promise - that no matter what level of skill you are currently at, as long as you apply the principles it teaches, you will be able to reach Diamond 5 rank within 30 days of playing on a fresh account. Mind you, that's regardless of whether you started as a Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum or a completely new player that has just installed the game. The reason why the book delivered on its promise for so many people was simple. I was aware that no matter what your starting point is, as long as you fill in the knowledge gaps that you have about the game and you apply the proven principles that my book teaches, you WILL completely transform as a player over a short period of time. There are no ifs, buts or shoulds - facts are facts and results are results. Well, due to multiple requests from dozens of people online, I was motivated to roll up my sleeves again for Season 7. So I wrote the book you are about to read next - 21 Days to Diamond and Beyond. It is a longer and more detailed, improved, enriched and polished version of 30 Days to Diamond and it has been created specifically for Season 7. Please don't get intimidated by the length of it - I assure you that every page is worth your time. And I am now going to make an even bolder promise - if you take the time to learn all the principles and techniques I teach you in 21 Days to Diamond and Beyond, you will be able to reach a minimum of Diamond 5 rank within 21 days of playing on an unranked account, regardless of what your starting position happens to be right now. You could be Bronze, Silver, Gold or completely new to League of Legends. If your goal is to improve as much as you can at League in a short period of time - because you are a very competitive person, you like winning or you just want to have more fun playing the game - then this book will be your best friend.

In The Zoom, Nick Hall traces the century-spanning history of the zoom lens in American film and television. From late 1920s silent features to the psychedelic experiments of the 1960s and beyond, the book describes how inventors battled to provide film and television studios with practical zoom lenses, and how cinematographers clashed over the right ways to use the new zooms. Hall demonstrates how the zoom brought life and energy to cinema decades before the zoom boom of the 1970s and reveals how the zoom continues to play a vital and often overlooked role in the production of contemporary film and television.  ",$25.35,

43021,019516895X,book,paperback,Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (Oxford History of the United States),James M. McPherson,Oxford University Press," Filled with fresh interpretations and information, puncturing old myths and challenging new ones, Battle Cry of Freedom will unquestionably become the standard one-volume history of the Civil War.James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War--the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry--and then moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering on both sides, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory.The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict: the South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war--slavery--and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This ""new birth of freedom,"" as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict.This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing ""second American Revolution"" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.",$15.08,4.7

How did we get to a place where bullshit is not just rife but apparently so effective that it's become the communications strategy of our times? This brilliantly insightful book steps inside the panoply of deception employed in all walks of life and assesses how it has come to this. It sets out the surprising logic which explains why bullshit is both pervasive and persistent. Why are company annual reports often nonsense? Why should you not trust estate agents? And above all, why has political campaigning become the art of stretching the truth? Drawing on behavioural science, economics, psychology and of course his knowledge of the media, Evan ends by providing readers with a tool-kit to handle the kinds of deceptions we encounter every day, and charts a route through the muddy waters of the post-truth age.",$13.47,3.0

Roy PhD,Deep River Books LLC," God gives dreams during critical and dangerous times, often arriving at pivotal moments in the flow of human history. If we can understand God’s dealings with humanity through dreams, we are better positioned to understand His will for us today. God of Dreams offers in-depth treatment of all types of dreamers and dreams, particularly the dreamers in scripture and their unique purpose in God’s plan. Author and doctor of psychology Archie W.N. Roy, PhD investigates dream interpreting and its biblical context. In God of Dreams, Roy focuses on dream language and symbol― their relationship to various kinds of dreams―and why we have dreams. He considers the insights we can gain from the modern day psychoanalysts, as well as from famous Christian dreamers such as John Newton, John Paul Jackson and Jackie Pullinger. He also critiques recent Christian writing which he feels has gone too far in its uncritical embrace of analytical psychology. We live in a different time from the days recorded in the Old Testament. We have received more revelation, especially regarding God’s grace and the way of salvation by means of the new covenant. But are we also not living in a time of critical junctures and pivotal moments? There is a place for listening to God’s dreams in these present times of turbulent change. We should listen to what He says through all His means, including dreams, and take action. The intended readership includes: the general Christian public interested in dreams, visions and the prophetic; Christian academics and theologians; bible college students; Christian students interested in dreams and Depth Psychology.",$10.87,4.5

43038,1499590261,book,paperback,Great Expectations: Original and Unabridged,Charles Dickens,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," This edition contains the original and unabridged text of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens. Great Expectations is a coming-of-age novel, and it is a classic work of Victorian literature. It depicts the growth and personal development of an orphan named Pip. Dickens felt Great Expectations was his best work, calling it “a very fine idea”. Great Expectations has become very popular and is now taught as a classic in many English classes. Great Expectations is set among the marshes of Kent and in London in the early to mid-1800s. It is a graphic book, full of extreme imagery, poverty, prison ships, “the hulks,” barriers and chains, and fights to the death. It combines intrigue and unexpected twists of autobiographical detail. The novel reflects the events of the time, Dickens' concerns, and the relationship between society and man. Dickens originally intended Great Expectations to be twice as long. Collected and dense, with a conciseness unusual for Dickens, the novel represents Dickens' peak and maturity as an author. According to G. K. Chesterton, Dickens penned Great Expectations in ""the afternoon of [his] life and fame."" The novel has a colourful cast that has entered popular culture: the capricious Miss Havisham, the cold and beautiful Estella, Joe the kind and generous blacksmith, the dry and sycophantic Uncle Pumblechook, Mr. Jaggers, Wemmick with his dual personality, and the eloquent and wise friend, Herbert Pocket.

Where do you begin learning about anesthesia when the basic books are over 800 pages long and weigh four pounds? Even when you do read these books, how will you translate the information into something you can use in the operating room when you are first starting out?  Welcome to Anesthesia Made Easy. I wrote this book to introduce you to anesthesiology. It is part education guide (to teach you the basics of anesthesia) and part survival guide (to teach you how to apply these basics while in the operating room). It includes the basics of anesthesia without getting too far into the weeds and also gives you a practical approach that will get you started moving in the right direction. New anesthesiology students struggle with which book to read and where to start. This book will give you not only a solid foundation upon which to start your career but also organize the information in such a way that you can actually use it. At under 200 pages, it is the one basic anesthesia book that you can reasonable read cover to cover quickly.  If you are doing anesthesia observations or shadowing to see if anesthesia is a good fit for you, you should start with chapter 1, “How to Get the Most from Your Anesthesiology Observation.” Then read chapter 4, “Anesthesiology Basic Concepts,” and chapter 5, “Getting Around in the OR,” to learn the culture of the OR—they will bring you a long way. If you are applying to AA or CRNA school, then read this book cover to cover before you interview. It will give you a working knowledge of the type of training you will receive. It may also help you in your interview process to give you answers to simple questions about anesthesia care.  If you are an airway rotator, concentrate on chapter 19, “Airway Exam and Evaluation,” chapter 7, “Basic Anesthesia Pharmacology: Medications,” and chapter 24 “Adult Airway Management,” chapter 25 “Pediatric Airway Management,” and chapter 27 “Rapid Sequence Induction (RSI).”  If you are on your first anesthesia rotation, start at the front of Anesthesia Made Easy and work your way through before you start your rotation. This book is meant to be a quick read. Bring the book with you to the operating room and take notes in the notes section.  Looking for more information about anesthesiology?

It explores the state of the modern world, and the strengths and weaknesses of the contemporary religious scene, by taking his central character, Father Elijah Schafer, a Carmelite priest, on a secret mission for the Vatican which embroils him in a series of crises and subterfuges affecting the ultimate destiny of the Church.Father Elijah is a convert from Judaism, a survivor of the Holocaust, a man once powerful in Israel. For twenty years he has been ""buried in the dark night of Carmel"" on the mountain of the prophet Elijah. The Pope and the Cardinal Secretary of State call him out of obscurity and give him a task of the highest sensitivity: to penetrate into the inner circles of a man whom they believe may be the Antichrist. Their purpose: to call the Man of Sin to repentance, and thus to postpone the great tribulation long enough to preach the Gospel to the whole world.In this richly textured tale, Father Elijah crosses Europe and the Middle East, moves through the echelons of world power, meets saints and sinners, presidents, judges, mystics, embattled Catholic journalists, faithful priests and a conspiracy of traitors within the very House of God. This is an apocalypse in the old literary sense, but one that was written in the light of Christian revelation.",$16.95,4.7

Generation after generation, Chicagoans pass down their almost religious allegiances to teams, stadiums, and players and their never-say-die attitude, along with the stories of the city’s best (and worst) sports moments. And every one of those moments—every come-from-behind victory or crushing defeat—has been chronicled by Chicago’s unparalleled sportswriters.In From Black Sox to Three-Peats, veteran Chicago sports columnist Ron Rapoportassembles one hundred of the best columns and articles from the Tribune, Sun-Times, Daily News, Defender, and other papers to tell the unforgettable story of a century of Chicago sports. From Ring Lardner to Rick Telander, Westbrook Pegler to Bob Verdi, Mike Royko to Hugh Fullerton , Melissa Isaacson to Brent Musburger, and on and on, this collection reminds us that Chicago sports fans have enjoyed a wealth of talent not just on the field, but in the press box as well. Through their stories we relive the betrayal of the Black Sox, the cocksure power of the ’85 Bears, the assassin’s efficiency of Jordan’s Bulls, the Blackhawks’ stunning reclamation of the Stanley Cup, the Cubs’ century of futility—all as seen in the moment, described and interpreted on the spot by some of the most talented columnists ever to grace a sports page.Sports are the most ephemeral of news events: once you know the outcome, the drama is gone. But every once in a while, there are those games, those teams, those players that make it into something more—and great writers can transform those fleeting moments into lasting stories that become part of the very identity of a city. From Black Sox to Three-Peats is Chicago history at its most exciting and celebratory. No sports fan should be without it.",$10.95,4.5

White,White Knight Press," The Sony DSC-RX100 has been hailed by reviewers and general photographers as one of the highest-quality compact digital cameras ever produced. With its larger-than-normal image sensor, superior image quality, and impressive array of features for creative photography, this camera has attracted a large and dedicated following in the photography community. However, the camera does not come with a printed manual, or even a PDF manual that can readily be printed for reference. So, until now, it has been difficult for users of the camera to find answers to their questions about the use of the camera's many controls, menus, and features. With the release of this new book, White Knight Press has provided users of the RX100 with a comprehensive guide to all operations, features, menus, and controls of this amazing camera. Using a patient, tutorial-like approach, the book provides guidance to beginning and intermediate photographers not only about how to accomplish things with the RX100, but when and why to use the camera's many features.

The book also provides full details of the camera's numerous menu options for playback, setup, and customizing the operation of the various buttons and other controls. The book's more than 300 photographs, most of them in full color, illustrate the RX100's controls, shooting screens, and menus. The photographs also provide examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the Photo Creativity settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing of images; the Scene shooting mode, with settings that are optimized for various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and action shots; the Creative Style and Picture Effect menu options, which offer dramatic options for altering the appearance of images; and the camera's strong array of features for continuous shooting and shooting in dim lighting. In addition, the book goes beyond the bounds of everyday photography, and provides introductions to more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, astrophotography, and macro photography. The book also includes a full discussion of the video recording abilities of the RX100, which can shoot high-definition (HD) video with stereo sound, and which offers manual control of exposure and focus during movie recording.

Join the Random House Reader's Circle for author chats and more. * When Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bill Dedman noticed in 2009 a grand home for sale, unoccupied for nearly sixty years, he stumbled through a surprising portal into American history. Empty Mansions is a rich mystery of wealth and loss, connecting the Gilded Age opulence of the nineteenth century with a twenty-first-century battle over a $300 million inheritance. At its heart is a reclusive heiress named Huguette Clark, a woman so secretive that, at the time of her death at age 104, no new photograph of her had been seen in decades. Though she owned palatial homes in California, New York, and Connecticut, why had she lived for twenty years in a simple hospital room, despite being in excellent health? Why were her valuables being sold off? Was she in control of her fortune, or controlled by those managing her money?   Dedman has collaborated with Huguette Clark's cousin, Paul Clark Newell, Jr., one of the few relatives to have frequent conversations with her. Dedman and Newell tell a fairy tale in reverse: the bright, talented daughter, born into a family of extreme wealth and privilege, who secrets herself away from the outside world.   Huguette was the daughter of self-made copper industrialist W. A. Clark, nearly as rich as Rockefeller in his day, a controversial senator, railroad builder, and founder of Las Vegas. She grew up in the largest house in New York City, a remarkable dwelling with 121 rooms for a family of four. She owned paintings by Degas and Renoir, a world-renowned Stradivarius violin, a vast collection of antique dolls. But wanting more than treasures, she devoted her wealth to buying gifts for friends and strangers alike, to quietly pursuing her own work as an artist, and to guarding the privacy she valued above all else.   The Clark family story spans nearly all of American history in three generations, from a log cabin in Pennsylvania to mining camps in the Montana gold rush, from backdoor politics in Washington to a distress call from an elegant Fifth Avenue apartment. The same Huguette who was touched by the terror attacks of 9/11 held a ticket nine decades earlier for a first-class stateroom on the second voyage of the Titanic.   Empty Mansions reveals a complex portrait of the mysterious Huguette and her intimate circle. We meet her extravagant father, her publicity-shy mother, her star-crossed sister, her French boyfriend, her nurse who received more than $30 million in gifts, and the relatives fighting to inherit Huguette's copper fortune. Richly illustrated with more than seventy photographs, Empty Mansions is an enthralling story of an eccentric of the highest order, a last jewel of the Gilded Age who lived life on her own terms.Praise for Empty Mansions  ""An amazing story of profligate wealth . . . an outsized tale of rags-to-riches prosperity.""--The New York Times  ""An evocative and rollicking read, part social history, part hothouse mystery, part grand guignol.""--The Daily Beast   ""Fascinating . . .

Afrin M.D., Kendra Neilsen Myles, Kristi Posival","Sisters Media, LLC"," In 2008 Dr. Afrin started coming to understand that a newly recognized type of mast cell disease, now called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS), was the underlying diagnosis in many patients he was seeing who were each suffering large assortments — quite different from one patient to the next — of chronic multisystem inflammatory illnesses of unclear cause.  Dr. Afrin soon gained experience that MCAS is far more prevalent than the only mast cell disease previously known to medicine (the rare disease of mastocytosis) and that most MCAS patients, once accurately diagnosed, can eventually find significantly helpful medications targeted at the disease.  The frequency and magnitude of the improvements Dr. Afrin has seen — even the relief that comes from finally having a unifying diagnosis other than ""psychosomatism"" — have spurred him to focus in this area, not only tending to the needs of his patients but also pursuing research to advance our understanding of the disease and helping to educate other professionals who in turn can help even more of the many people who have long been suffering not only the symptoms of the disease but also the natural concern of not understanding why one would be so ""unlucky"" to have acquired so many medical problems.  As it turns out, such patients are not so unlucky and truly have just one root issue (and a very common one at that), which has the biological capability to develop, directly or indirectly, into most or all of their previously diagnosed problems.  There is a great deal yet to learn about this, but even with just the present very limited understanding, the opportunity to diagnose and help patients with MCAS seems to be enormous and Dr. Afrin felt a description of the disease, written for the general public, might help lead some MCAS patients on a journey to diagnosis and improvement sooner rather than later.  Dr. Afrin hopes this book will help people who might have, or do have, MCAS.  A portion of the proceeds of purchases of this book will go to support research and education in this area.",$22.95,4.8

43106,1580053327,book,paperback,Outdated: Why Dating Is Ruining Your Love Life,Samhita Mukhopadhyay,Seal Press," Romance and love are in a state of crisis: Statistically speaking, young women today are living romantic lives of all kindsbut they’re still feeling bogged down by social, cultural, economic, and familial pressures to love in a certain way. Young women in the modern world have greater flexibility than ever when it comes to who we choose to love and how we choose to love them; but while social circumstances may have changed since our parents’ generation, certain life expectations remain. In Outdated, Samhita Mukhopadhyay addresses the difficulty of negotiating loving relationships within the borderlands of race, culture, class, and sexualityand of holding true to our convictions and maintaining our independence while we do it.Outdated analyzes how different forms of media, cultural norms, family pressure, and even laws, are produced to scare women into believing that if they don’t devote themselves to finding a man, they’ll be doomed to a life of loneliness and shame. Using interviews with young women that are living around, between, within, and outside of the romantic industrial complex, Mukhopadhyay weaves a narrative of the alternative ways that women today have elected to live their lives, and in doing so offers a fresh, feminist look at an old topic: How do diverse, independent young women date happily and successfullyand outside of the box?",$13.45,3.7

So when a wealthy, obnoxious tourist and his ski bunny girlfriend surface in Pru Marlowe’s little Berkshire town, she knows she should stay out of their way. The bad-girl animal psychic has to focus on more immediate concerns, including a wild rabbit named Henry, supposedly tamed and illegally living with an eighty-four-year-old lady in her home. Henry, who seems to be acting out and hiding, avoids responding to Pru.Yet when Pru discovers the tourist murdered and his girlfriend’s high-maintenance spaniel falls to her care, she gets dragged into a complicated case of crime and punishment that involves some new friends, an old nemesis, and her own shadowed past. A recent museum art heist draws the feds into the investigation along with a courtly gentleman radiating menace, who represents secretive business interests in New York and shows a surprising awareness of Pru. Her on-again, off-again romance with police Detective Creighton doesn’t stop him from warning her to steer clear of the inquiry. The spaniel, however, lures her in. Pru lives in a world where only her crotchety tabby Wallis knows the whole truth about her past, her flight from Manhattan, and her unique gift that surfaced abruptly one day. Fearing the worst, Pru now comes dangerously close to being exposed. With everything in motion, Pru, Wallis, and everyone they hold dear will be lucky to escape…by a hare.",$12.50,4.0

43131,226182010,book,paperback,Awake in the Dark: The Best of Roger Ebert,"Roger Ebert, David Bordwell",University Of Chicago Press," Roger Ebert has been writing film reviews for the Chicago Sun-Times for nearly forty years. And during those four decades, his wide knowledge, keen judgment, prodigious energy, and sharp sense of humor have made him America’s most celebrated film critic. He was the first such critic to win a Pulitzer Prize—one of just three film critics ever to receive that honor—and the only one to have a star dedicated to him on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. His groundbreaking hit TV show, At the Movies, meanwhile, has made “two thumbs up” one of the most coveted hallmarks in the entire industry. No critic alive has reviewed more movies than Roger Ebert, and yet his essential writings have never been collected in a single volume—until now. With Awake in the Dark, both fans and film buffs can finally bask in the best of Ebert’s work. The reviews, interviews, and essays collected here present a picture of this indispensable critic’s numerous contributions to the cinema and cinephilia. From The Godfather to GoodFellas, from Cries and Whispers to Crash, the reviews in Awake in the Dark span some of the most exceptional periods in film history, from the dramatic rise of rebel Hollywood and the heyday of the auteur, to the triumph of blockbuster films such as Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, to the indie revolution that is still with us today. The extraordinary interviews gathered in Awake in the Dark capture Ebert engaging not only some of the most influential directors of our time—Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Woody Allen, Robert Altman, Werner Herzog, and Ingmar Bergman—but also some of the silver screen’s most respected and dynamic personalities, including actors as diverse as Robert Mitchum, James Stewart, Warren Beatty, and Meryl Streep. Ebert’s remarkable essays play a significant part in Awake in the Dark as well. The book contains some of Ebert’s most admired pieces, among them a moving appreciation of John Cassavetes and a loving tribute to the virtues of black-and-white films. If Pauline Kael and Andrew Sarris were godmother and godfather to the movie generation, then Ebert is its voice from within—a writer whose exceptional intelligence and daily bursts of insight and enthusiasm have shaped the way we think about the movies. Awake in the Dark, therefore, will be a treasure trove not just for fans of this seminal critic, but for anyone desiring a fascinating and compulsively readable chronicle of film since the late 1960s.",$17.82,4.8

Here’s what really happens during mental and physical performance when we crack under pressure, and here are simple ways not to choke in stressful situations.Why do the smartest students often do poorly on standardized tests?Why did you tank that interview or miss that golf swing when you should have had it in the bag?Why do you mess up when it matters the most—and how can you perform your best instead?It happens to all of us. You’ve prepared for days, weeks, even years for the big day when you will finally show your stuff—in academics, in your career, in sports—but when the big moment arrives, nothing seems to work. You hit the wrong note, drop the ball, get stumped by a simple question. In other words, you choke. It’s not fun to think about, but now there’s good news: This doesn’t have to happen.Dr. Sian Beilock, an expert on performance and brain science, reveals in Choke the astonishing new science of why we all too often blunder when the stakes are high. What happens in our brain and body when we experience the dreaded performance anxiety? And what are we doing differently when everything magically “clicks” into place and the perfect golf swing, tricky test problem, or high-pressure business pitch becomes easy? In an energetic tour of the latest brain science, with surprising insights on every page, Beilock explains the inescapable links between body and mind; reveals the surprising similarities among the ways performers, students, athletes, and business people choke; and shows how to succeed brilliantly when it matters most. In lively prose and accessibly rendered science, Beilock examines how attention and working memory guide human performance, how experience and practice and brain development interact to create our abilities, and how stress affects all these factors. She sheds new light on counterintuitive realities, like why the highest performing people are most susceptible to choking under pressure, why we may learn foreign languages best when we’re not paying attention, why early childhood athletic training can backfire, and how our emotions can make us both smarter and dumber. All these fascinating findings about academic, athletic, and creative intelligence come together in Beilock’s new ideas about performance under pressure—and her secrets to never choking again. Whether you’re at the Olympics, in the boardroom, or taking the SAT, Beilock’s clear, prescriptive guidance shows how to remain cool under pressure—the key to performing well when everything’s on the line.",$9.28,3.9

43140,1499590253,book,paperback,Oliver Twist: Original and Unabridged,Charles Dickens,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," This edition contains the original and unabridged text of Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens. Oliver Twist, the second novel by Charles Dickens, is about an orphan who endures a miserable existence in a workhouse before he is placed with an undertaker. He escapes and travels to London where he meets the Artful Dodger, leader of a gang of juvenile pickpockets. Naïvely unaware of their unlawful activities, Oliver is led to the lair of their elderly criminal trainer Fagin. Oliver Twist is notable for Dickens's unromantic portrayal of criminals and their sordid lives. The book exposed the cruel treatment of the many orphans in London during the Dickensian era. An early example of the social novel, the book calls the public’s attention to various contemporary evils, including child labour, the recruitment of children as criminals, and the presence of street children. Dickens mocks the hypocrisies of his time by surrounding the novel’s serious themes with sarcasm and dark humour. It is likely that Dickens’s own early youth as a child labourer contributed to the story’s development.",$13.49,4.4

43147,184850960X,book,paperback,Mind Over Medicine: Scientific Proof That You Can Heal Yourself,Lissa Rankin,Hay House Inc.," A NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERAS SEEN ON NATIONAL PUBLIC TELEVISION  We’ve been led to believe that when we get sick, it’s our genetics. Or it’s just bad luck—and doctors alone hold the keys to optimal health. Therefore when Dr. Lissa Rankin’s own health started to suffer, she turned to Western medical treatments, but what she found was that they not only failed to help; they made her worse. So she decided to take matters into her own hands. Through her research, Dr. Rankin discovered that the health care she had been taught to practice was missing something crucial: a recognition of the body’s innate ability to self-repair and an appreciation for how we can control these self-healing mechanisms with the power of the mind. To better understand this phenomenon, she explored peer-reviewed medical literature and found evidence that the medical establishment had been proving that the body can heal itself for over 50 years.  Using extraordinary cases of spontaneous healing, Dr. Rankin shows how thoughts, feelings, and beliefs can alter the body’s physiology. She lays out the scientific data proving that loneliness, pessimism, depression, fear, and anxiety damage the body, while intimate relationships, gratitude, meditation, sex, and authentic self-expression flip on the body’s self-healing processes. In this book, you’ll find a radical new wellness model based on Dr. Rankin’s scientific findings. Her unique six-step program will help you uncover where things might be out of whack in your life—spiritually, creatively, environmentally, nutritionally, and in your professional and personal relationships—so that you can create a customized treatment plan aimed at bolstering these health-promoting pieces of your life. You’ll learn how to listen to your body’s “whispers” before they turn to life-threatening “screams” that can be prevented with proper self-care, and you’ll learn how to trust your inner guidance when making decisions about your health and your life. By the time you finish Mind Over Medicine, you’ll have made your own Diagnosis, written your own Prescription, and created a clear action plan designed to help you make your body ripe for miracles.",$13.82,4.5

This book is intended to show how a brushless motor works. The basic principle is discussed first, before all the key terms such as kV and rpm/V, operating voltage, load and idle current, torque, turns, electrical and mechanical power, losses, efficiency, etc. are explained. A brushless motor can't work without a brushless controller, it requires a three-phase AC voltage. To increase the speed properly, the controller must have information on the rotor position. This can be done by Hall sensors or directly via the motor windings. All that will be taken into account in the book.              Contents:1.

Yet few of the many works on the enigmatic warrior have hewn to the original sources. Fewer still have explored the emotional turmoil that drove him on to be the very best in his field.A Life in Arms debunks many of the convenient myths, while at the same time uncovering the more controversial aspects that have been left hidden: his deeply troubled relationship with his father, his whereabouts during the battle of Sekigahara, his role in the siege of Osaka castle, and the birth and death of an illegitimate child, an event that deeply influenced his art.It shows how Musashi's path through life was shaped by strong personal traits: a reckless valor in the face of danger, a sensitive intelligence in the fields of art and architecture, a generosity toward peers and pupils, and a defiant stubbornness in old age. The complex yet human portrait that arises is a far cry from the accepted one-dimensional caricatures.Drawing from a wealth of images, maps, photographs, and woodprints, this Illustrated Edition gives the reader an even more authentic and in-depth experience of the life of Japan's greatest swordsman.",$29.50,

It was his only complete book and became the bible of National Socialism in the German Third Reich. It was published in two volumes, which dated 1925 and 1927. By 1939 it had sold 5,200,000 copies and had been translated into 11 different languages. The first volume, entitled Die Abrechnung (“The Settlement of Accounts,” or “Revenge”), was written in 1924 in the Bavarian fortress of Landsberg am Lech. Hitler was imprisoned there after the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch of 1923. It describes the world of Hitlers youth, the First World War and the betrayal of Germany in 1918. It also expresses Hitlers Racial ideology. According to Hitler, it was necessary for Germans to occupy themselves not merely with the breeding of cats, dogs and horses - but also care for the health and wellbeing of their own Bloodline. The second volume, entitled Die Nationalsozialistische Bewegung (“The National Socialist Movement”), was written after Hitlers release from prison in December 1924. It outlines the political program of National Socialism and includes the measures that National Socialism must pursue in both gaining power and in exercising it thereafter in the new German Reich. In this book Hitler describes an ideology which according to him must shake the world from its slumber. An ideology which is based on the Eternal Laws of Nature. Here you can notice how the foundations of Social Darwinism have been applied in practice. This book has set a path toward a much higher understanding of the self and of our magnificent destiny as living beings part of this Race on our planet. It shows us that we must not look at nature in terms of good or bad, but in an unfiltered manner. It describes what we must do if we want to survive as a people and as a Race. We have to understand that Nature does not forgive weakness and that the truth and reality is what it is, no matter how bad it may seem or how hard it can portray itself. This book shows the foundations of White Resistance and White Nationalism. It is the foundation and seed for the preservation of our Race. Be advised that this book does not represent the full Racialist ideology, but it is only a foundation as the Origin of Species is a foundation for the Theory of Evolution.

His forgetting causes confusion, and in his fear and uncertainty he sometimes lashes out at those who try to care for him. But when someone reads a favorite Psalm he quickly joins in, reciting each cherished word. When he hears an old hymn of faith, his hand slowly raises and he breathes out each word quietly, his face reflecting a peace that passes all understanding.Alzheimer’s disease has been described as the “defining disease” of the baby boomer generation. Millions of Americans will spend much of their retirement years either caring for a loved one with Alzheimer’s disease or experiencing its effects on their lives firsthand. When a person is diagnosed with Alzheimer’s, they face great uncertainty, knowing that they can expect to live their remaining years with increasing confusion and progressively greater reliance upon other people to care for them. As the disease advances it seems to overwhelm a person, narrowing their focus and leading them to forget critical truths about the Lord, their life with him, and his promises.Through the personal stories of those affected and the loved ones who care for them, Dr. Benjamin Mast highlights the power of the gospel for those suffering from Alzheimer’s disease. Filled with helpful, up-to-date information, Dr. Mast answers common questions about the disease and its effect on personal identity and faith as he explores the biblical importance of remembering and God’s commitment to not forget his people. In addition, he gives practical suggestions for how the church can come alongside families and those struggling, offering help and hope to victims of this debilitating disease.If you are a Christian who knows or loves someone with Alzheimer’s disease, have recently been diagnosed with early Alzheimer’s disease, or are a pastor or ministry leader seeking to better understand and minister to people with Alzheimer’s disease this book will encourage you with the good news of God’s faithfulness and the future hope he calls us to.",$13.91,4.8

The Elephant’s Secret Sense is O’Connell’s account of her groundbreaking research into seismic listening and communication, chronicling the extraordinary social lives of elephants over the course of fourteen years in the Namibian wilderness.             This compelling odyssey of scientific discovery is also a frank account of fieldwork in a poverty-stricken, war-ravaged country.

And while, like so many of his contemporaries, he is prone to the unabashed Orientalism of his day, he is thankfully free of the “eczema of reformers.” Despite his determination to be of “extreme magnitude in the perspective,” Kirkland soon falls head-over heel for Japan’s irresistible charm, surprising us with his evocative, unprejudiced observations—of a group of men in conversation, of a whistful girl at a barber shop dreaming of another life.With Kirthland we discover a Japan that has by now all but disappeared, a rural and mystical landscape occupied by abandoned temples, thatched cottages, old inns that once hosted feudal lords on their way to the capital. It is a landscape inhabited by quintessentially Japanese characters—a white-bearded pilgrim leaning on his staff, a fairy-like girl carrying a barrel-sized basket on her back, her eyes fixed on some wild flowers in her hand. As to every visitor, past and present, Japan to Kirtland proves a country full of wonderful contradictions. Thus, lost in the mist among the mountains on the Nakasendô, he and his companions encounter a peasants in traditional rush grass cape, terrified at the sight of aliens, while at the next inn a maid sits down at the foot of his bed for a cigarette and a casual conversation about marriage.",$14.50,
43248,486415872,book,paperback,Crime and Punishment,"Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Constance Garnett",Dover Publications,"   The two years before he wrote Crime and Punishment (1866) had been bad ones for Dostoyevsky. His wife and brother had died; the magazine he and his brother had started, Epoch, collapsed under its load of debt; and he was threatened with debtor's prison. With an advance that he managed to wangle for an unwritten novel, he fled to Wiesbaden, hoping to win enough at the roulette table to get himself out of debt. Instead, he lost all his money; he had to pawn his clothes and beg friends for loans to pay his hotel bill and get back to Russia. One of his begging letters went to a magazine editor, asking for an advance on yet another unwritten novel — which he described as Crime and Punishment. One of the supreme masterpieces of world literature, Crime and Punishment catapulted Dostoyevsky to the forefront of Russian writers and into the ranks of the world's greatest novelists. Drawing upon experiences from his own prison days, the author recounts in feverish, compelling tones the story of Raskolnikov, an impoverished student tormented by his own nihilism, and the struggle between good and evil. Believing that he is above the law, and convinced that humanitarian ends justify vile means, he brutally murders an old woman — a pawnbroker whom he regards as ""stupid, ailing, greedy…good for nothing."" Overwhelmed afterwards by feelings of guilt and terror, Raskolnikov confesses to the crime and goes to prison. There he realizes that happiness and redemption can only be achieved through suffering. Infused with forceful religious, social, and philosophical elements, the novel was an immediate success. This extraordinary, unforgettable work is reprinted here in the authoritative Constance Garnett translation.A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.",$7.00,4.3

Did it quietly die away? Or were there still Indians who believed in his philosophy and methods, committed to continuing his work? These were the questions that sent independent journalist Mark Shepard to India in 1978-79. There he found that the tradition begun by Gandhi was very much alive, in such individuals, groups, and movements as: -- An acclaimed saint who collected over four million acres in gifts of land for the poor. -- A leader of a nationwide protest movement that helped topple India's ruling party in the mid-1970s. -- A Peace Army that fought riots with nonviolence. -- A ""Hug the Trees!"" movement that physically blocked excessive logging in the Himalayas. -- A People's Court that even tried cases of murder and government corruption. -- A development center helping 400 villages rise from poverty. -- A nationwide movement of villages in which all land was held in common and decisions were made by unanimous consent. Learn about all these and more in this engaging report on the legacy of the twentieth century's greatest peacemaker and revolutionary. ///////////////////////////////////////////////// Mark Shepard is the author of ""Mahatma Gandhi and His Myths,"" ""The Community of the Ark,"" and ""Gandhi Today,"" called by the American Library Association's Booklist ""a masterpiece of committed reporting.""

If so, is the main suspect in her death still at large?These questions and more are answered in former CNN, ESPN, and USA Today legal analyst Mark Shaw’s 25th book, The Reporter Who Knew Too Much. Through discovery of never-before-seen videotaped eyewitness interviews with those closest to Kilgallen and secret government documents, Shaw unfolds a “whodunit” murder mystery featuring suspects including Frank Sinatra, J. Edgar Hoover, Mafia Don Carlos Marcello and a ""Mystery Man"" who may have silenced Kilgallen. All while by presenting through Kilgallen's eyes the most compelling evidence about the JFK assassinations since the House Select Committee on Assassination’s investigation in the 1970s. Called by the New York Post, “the most powerful female voice in America,” and by acclaimed author Mark Lane the “the only serious journalist in America who was concerned with who killed John Kennedy and getting all of the facts about the assassination,” Kilgallen’s official cause of death reported as an overdose of barbiturates combined with alcohol, has always been suspect since no investigation occurred despite the death scene having been staged. Shaw proves Kilgallen, a remarkable woman who broke the ""glass ceiling"" before the term became fashionable, was denied the justice she deserved, that is until now.   More about the book may be learned at thereporterwhoknewtoomuch.com or thedorothykilgallenstory.org.",$10.87,4.1

Its influence on politics also cannot be denied. His book provided something people had waited for – a new scientific theory about wealth and inequality. However, there were criticism. Anti-Piketty: Capital for the 21st Century collects those essential criticisms from twenty specialists―economists, historians and tax experts―who provide scientific and rigorous arguments against Piketty's central theses. These researchers, who come from many countries and many backgrounds, examine the notions of inequality, growth, wealth and capital that Piketty treated in his book. They show in new ways how inequality did not explode, the rich are not rentiers but rather entrepreneurs who take risks and create millions of jobs, that wealth can not indefinitely grow faster than economic growth, and that radical taxation does not solve problems but aggravates them.",$12.88,3.9

Allan St John, Frank Schoonover",Engage Books," When John Carter goes to sleep in a mysterious cave in the Arizona dessert, he wakes up on the planet Mars. There he meets the fifteen foot tall, four armed, green men of mars, with horse-like dragons, and watch dogs like oversized frogs with ten legs. His adventures continue as he battles great white apes, fights plant men, defies the Goddess of Death, and braves the frozen wastes of Polar Mars. In other adventures, the Prince of Helium encounters a race of telepathic warriors, the Princess of Helium confronts the headless men of Mars, Captain Ulysses Paxton learns the secret of human immortality, and Tan Hadron's idealized notion of love is tested as he fights off gigantic spiders and cannibals. Edgar Rice Burroughs vision of Mars was loosely inspired by astronomical speculation of the time, especially that of Percival Lowell, who saw the red planet as a formerly Earth-like world now becoming less hospitable to life due to its advanced age. Burroughs predicted the invention of homing devices, radar, sonar, autopilot, collision detection, television, teletype, genetic cloning, living organ transplants, antigravity propulsion, and many other concepts that were well ahead of his time. The books in the Barsoom series were an early inspiration to many, including science fiction authors Robert A. Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury, they influenced renowned scientist Carl Sagan in his quest for extraterrestrial life, and were instrumental in the making of James Cameron's Avatar, and George Lucas' Star Wars.

Now this young writer, widely heralded as a once-in-a-generation talent, returns with a first novel that harnesses the sweeping vision and deep heart that made her debut so arresting to a love story set in a devastatingly imagined near future: Unrelenting drought has transfigured Southern California into a surreal, phantasmagoric landscape. With the Central Valley barren, underground aquifer drained, and Sierra snowpack entirely depleted, most “Mojavs,” prevented by both armed vigilantes and an indifferent bureaucracy from freely crossing borders to lusher regions, have allowed themselves to be evacuated to internment camps. In Los Angeles’ Laurel Canyon, two young Mojavs—Luz, once a poster child for the Bureau of Conservation and its enemies, and Ray, a veteran of the “forever war” turned surfer—squat in a starlet’s abandoned mansion. Holdouts, they subsist on rationed cola and whatever they can loot, scavenge, and improvise. The couple’s fragile love somehow blooms in this arid place, and for the moment, it seems enough. But when they cross paths with a mysterious child, the thirst for a better future begins. They head east, a route strewn with danger: sinkholes and patrolling authorities, bandits and the brutal, omnipresent sun. Ghosting after them are rumors of a visionary dowser—a diviner for water—and his followers, who whispers say have formed a colony at the edge of a mysterious sea of dunes. Immensely moving, profoundly disquieting, and mind-blowingly original, Watkins’s novel explores the myths we believe about others and tell about ourselves, the double-edged power of our most cherished relationships, and the shape of hope in a precarious future that may be our own.From the Hardcover edition.",$10.87,3.3

Life is scary. Adulting is hard. When faced with the challenges of building a life of your own, it’s all too easy to stake your hope and happiness in “someday.” But what if the dotted lines on the map at your feet today mattered just as much as the destination you dream of? Hannah Brencher, TED Talk speaker and founder of The World Needs More Love Letters, thought Atlanta was her destination. Yet even after she arrived, she found herself in the same old chase for the next best thing…somewhere else. And it left her in a state of anxiety and deep depression. Our hyper-connected era has led us to believe life should be a highlight reel—where what matters most is perfect beauty, instant success, and ready applause. Yet, as Hannah learned, nothing about faith, relationships, or character is instant. So she took up a new mantra: be where your feet are. Give yourself a permission slip to stop chasing the next big thing, and come matter here. Engage the process as much as you trust the God who lovingly leads you.If you are tired of running away from your life or tired of running ragged toward the next thing you think will make you feel complete, Come Matter Here will help you do whatever it takes to show up for the life God has for you.

Who does the “calling,” and how is it received?  In Prepare Them to Shepherd, pastor Brian Croft unpacks the biblical model for preparing individuals for full-time ministry. In the past, training and sending individuals into full-time pastoral ministry and missionary work was viewed as the responsibility of the local church. Today, much of that responsibility has been delegated to Bible colleges, seminaries, and parachurch and mission organizations.The aim of Prepare Them to Shepherd is to challenge local churches to recover the biblical model for ministerial training and assume responsibility to identify and prepare gifted and godly individuals for service in Christ’s body. Part of the Practical Shepherding series of books, this insightful book provides pastors and ministry leaders with the practical help they need to test, train, affirm, and send those who are called into ministry.",$12.99,4.4

43310,1451465726,book,paperback,Postmodernity and Univocity: A Critical Account of Radical Orthodoxy and John Duns Scotus,Daniel P. Horan,Fortress Press," Nearly twenty-five years ago, John Milbank inaugurated Radical Orthodoxy, one of the most significant and influential theological movements of the last two decades. In Milbank's Theology and Social Theory, he constructed a sweeping theological genealogy of the origins of modernity and the emergence of the secular, counterposed by a robust retrieval of traditional orthodoxy as the critical philosophical and theological mode of being in the postmodern world. That genealogy turns upon a critical pointthe work of John Duns Scotus as the starting point of modernity and progenitor of a raft of philosophical and theological ills that have prevailed since. Milbank's account has been disseminated proliferously through Radical Orthodoxy and even beyond and is largely uncontested in contemporary theology. The present volume conducts a comprehensive examination and critical analysis of Radical Orthodoxy's use and interpretation of John Duns Scotus. Daniel P. Horan, O.F.M. offers a substantial challenge to the narrative of Radical Orthodoxy's idiosyncratic take on Scotus and his role in ushering in the philosophical age of the modern. This volume not only corrects the received account of Scotus but opens a constructive way forward toward a positive assessment and appropriation of Scotus's work for contemporary theology.",$27.69,4.5

It marked the beginning of the military careers of many of those who would go on to fight the Civil War two decades later--including Robert E Lee and Ulysses S Grant. It took General Zachary Taylor to the Presidency, and re-ignited the debate over slavery that would later result in secession. During the war, Mexico, under the leadership of Santa Anna, lost over half of its national territory to the US and many Mexicans now found themselves on the wrong side of the border and living in the United States--a situation with direct bearing on current Mexican-US immigration. Justin H Smith's classic history of the war, written in 1919 from official archives in both countries, depicts the US as the wronged party, but many Americans at the time viewed the Mexican War as simply an American land grab, in which a large strong nation bullied territorial concessions from a smaller weaker neighbor.",$17.99,3.8

Street battles with spears and arrows in sweltering East Timor. Bone- jarring artillery duels in Afghanistan's mountains. Long patrols on the sandy wastes of southern Iraq. For four years, war was life for David Axe. He was alternately bored out of his mind and completely terrified. It was strangely addictive.  As a correspondent for The Washington Times, C-SPAN and BBC Radio, Axe flew from conflict to conflict, reveling in death, danger, and destruction abroad while, back in D.C., his apartment gathered dust, his plants died, and his relationships withered. War reporting was physically, emotionally, and financially draining-and disillusioning. Loosely based on the web comic of the same name, with extensive new material, War Is Boring takes us to Lebanon and Somalia; to arms bazaars across the United States; to Detroit, as David tries to reconnect with his family-and to Chad, as David attempts to bring attention to the Darfur genocide.Watch a Video ",$10.66,3.4

In this brilliant, witty, and accessible book, renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our satisfactions. With penetrating insight and sparkling prose, Gilbert explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become.",$10.00,4.0

43335,465040020,book,paperback,The Patient Will See You Now: The Future of Medicine Is in Your Hands,Eric Topol,Basic Books," The essential guide by one of America's leading doctors to how digital technology enables all of us to take charge of our health A trip to the doctor is almost a guarantee of misery. You'll make an appointment months in advance. You'll probably wait for several hours until you hear ""the doctor will see you now""-but only for fifteen minutes! Then you'll wait even longer for lab tests, the results of which you'll likely never see, unless they indicate further (and more invasive) tests, most of which will probably prove unnecessary (much like physicals themselves). And your bill will be astronomical.In The Patient Will See You Now, Eric Topol, one of the nation's top physicians, shows why medicine does not have to be that way. Instead, you could use your smartphone to get rapid test results from one drop of blood, monitor your vital signs both day and night, and use an artificially intelligent algorithm to receive a diagnosis without having to see a doctor, all at a small fraction of the cost imposed by our modern healthcare system.The change is powered by what Topol calls medicine's ""Gutenberg moment."" Much as the printing press took learning out of the hands of a priestly class, the mobile internet is doing the same for medicine, giving us unprecedented control over our healthcare. With smartphones in hand, we are no longer beholden to an impersonal and paternalistic system in which ""doctor knows best."" Medicine has been digitized, Topol argues; now it will be democratized. Computers will replace physicians for many diagnostic tasks, citizen science will give rise to citizen medicine, and enormous data sets will give us new means to attack conditions that have long been incurable. Massive, open, online medicine, where diagnostics are done by Facebook-like comparisons of medical profiles, will enable real-time, real-world research on massive populations. There's no doubt the path forward will be complicated: the medical establishment will resist these changes, and digitized medicine inevitably raises serious issues surrounding privacy. Nevertheless, the result-better, cheaper, and more human health care-will be worth it.Provocative and engrossing, The Patient Will See You Now is essential reading for anyone who thinks they deserve better health care. That is, for all of us.",$12.91,4.5

The brat tries to poison him, follows him around the dark city, and breaks into his apartment when she assumes he is not home. It’s time for Jean to take her in hand before she gets them both killed. Paul Deaux is head of Deaux Consultants. Like his twin Jean, he concentrates in eliminating problems. New employee Jayne Anne Richard is delightful, and her innocence attracts the jaded man. She has a tendency to daydream, but he is determined to show her how exciting real life can be. Unfortunately, with reality, comes danger. Now Paul must protect her from the evils of those the twins’ company deals with daily. Publisher’s Note: These romances are intended for adults only. They contain danger, suspense, mystery, humor, sensual scenes, and adult language. If any of these offend you, please do not purchase.",$15.95,

43392,199217947,book,paperback,The Portrait of a Lady (Oxford World's Classics),"Henry James, Roger Luckhurst",Oxford University Press," Henry James is one of the giants of American literary history. From the novella ""Daisy Miller"" and classic short stories such as ""The Turn of the Screw"" to the popular short novel Washington Square and intricately woven and highly complex later novels such as The Golden Bowl and The Ambassadors, James's work is a required stop on any journey through our nation's artistic and cultural heritage.  An undisputed masterpiece, The Portrait of a Lady is arguably James's most popular work, and certainly the finest of his early novels. It focuses on Isabel Archer, a young, intelligent, and spirited American girl, determined to relish her first experience of Europe. She rejects two eligible suitors in her fervent commitment to liberty and independence, declaring that she will never marry. Thanks to the generosity of her devoted cousin Ralph, she is free to make her own choice about her destiny. Yet in the intoxicating worlds of Paris, Florence, and Rome, her fond illusions of self-reliance are twisted by the machinations of her friends and apparent allies. What had seemed to be a vista of infinite promise steadily closes around her and becomes instead a ""house of suffocation."" Portrait of a Lady is at once a dramatic Victorian tale of betrayal and a wholly modern psychological study of a woman caught in a web of relations she only comes to understand too late. This new edition includes helpful notes on the numerous changes James made between the first edition and the revised New York Edition, reproduced here, an up-to-date bibliography, and a new chronology.About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

We are witness here to an almost religious celebration of the flesh: a flesh vital with the vulnerability of love and loss, to desire and its departure. In an extraordinary blend of McMillan's own colloquial Yorkshire rhythms with a sinewy, Metaphysical music and Thom Gunn's torque and speed -- 'your kiss was deep enough to stand in' -- the poems in this first collection confront what it is to be a man and interrogate the very idea of masculinity. This is poetry where every instance of human connection, from the casual encounter to the intimate relationship, becomes redeemable and revelatory. There is, at the end of everything, a sense of hope.      Dispensing with conventional punctuation, the poet is attentive and alert to the quality of breathing, giving the work an extraordinary sense of being vividly poised and present -- drawing lines that are deft, lyrical and perfectly pitched from a world of urban dereliction. An elegant stylist and unfashionably honest poet, McMillan believes that 'writing something down/keeps it alive', and his eye and ear are tuned, exactly, to both the mechanics of the body and the miracles of the heart.",$8.02,5.0

Hands-on government support, meanwhile, focused on creative industries as a significant part of the economy and turned intellectual property rights into a significant revenue source.

The new book, like the earlier ones, explains all operations, features, menus, and controls of the camera in clear language, providing guidance to beginning and intermediate photographers not only about how to accomplish things with the camera, but when and why to use certain features. The book does not assume any specialized knowledge by the reader as it explains topics such as autofocus, manual focus, depth of field, aperture priority, shutter priority, HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography, and macro photography. The book also includes a detailed discussion of techniques for using the camera's phenomenal zoom lens, with a maximum focal length of 1000mm, to full advantage. The book's more than 200 photographs, almost all in full color, provide illustrations of the camera's controls and menus, and also include examples of the various types of photographs that can be taken using the many creative settings of the camera, including the Picture Control settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing of images; the special Scene and Effects shooting modes, with settings that are optimized for various subjects, including landscapes, portraits, and action shots; and the camera's particularly strong array of features for continuous shooting and interval shooting. In addition, the book goes beyond the realm of everyday photography, and provides introductions to more advanced topics such as infrared photography, street photography, and creating 3D (three-dimensional) images that can be viewed with conventional red and blue 3D glasses. The book also includes a full discussion of the video recording abilities of the Coolpix P510, which can record high-definition (HD) video with stereo sound, and which has special settings for recording short clips of high-speed video at rates up to 4 times normal speed. In three appendices, the book provides information about accessories available for the camera, sets forth a list of useful web sites and other resources for further information, and includes a section with helpful ""quick tips"" that give particular insights into how to take advantage of the camera's features in the most efficient ways possible.",$24.95,4.7

43449,1522041400,book,paperback,The Secret of Chess,Lyudmil Tsvetkov,Independently published," Learn the secrets of chess from the only person able to beat the world number 1 chess engine Stockfish. Learn chess 5 times easier through pattern recognition. Attain deep chess knowledge in an intuitive way through a wealth of diagrams(more than 500). Read about topics no other chess author has ever discussed in the past. This book is an entertaining story, combining in one all the elements of positional evaluation in chess. Learn things from the future of chess. Learning straight from the author who has contributed a lot for the development of the strongest chess engine on Earth, Stockfish. ABOVE sentences someone might find conceited, but are mostly true. In this book you will find everything one needs to know about positional evaluation, from tactical features, like pins and discovered checks, to deeply strategic ones, like pointed chains and king shelter weaknesses. The book has incorporated almost all of the concepts available in other reference material, but that is just the start. No matter how unbelievable that might seem to you, half of the featured elements are completely NEW to chess theory, a product of endless analsysis sessions with Stockfish and Komodo chess engines, as well as the use of statistical points, derived from a large number of high-quality game databases, one of which is TCEC, the strongest computer chess championship in the world, played at very long time control. So that, when you are reading this, the signature is not only mine, but partly also that of Stockfish and Komodo. The creative ideas are mine, but without the valuable help of the chess engines, I would never have been able to do that the same way. Please, don't be afraid by the numbers used for qualifying all evaluation features: this is done just for the sake of precision, but it is very easy to convert those numbers to usual human assessments. For example, if a feature is assessed with +50cps(cp, centipawn is one hundredth of a full pawn material), that will mean the feature is good. When you see +100cps and above, the feature is very good. If between 0 and 20cps, the feature is still good and useful, but less so. Similarly, for features with negative values, the higher the value, the worse the specific feature is. One gets accustomed to these values and then everything is fine. The book gives a definition for each specific evaluation pattern, a diagram specifies it, and then you get more detailed information about the characteristics of the term, real-game examples and a mention of how frequent this term occurs on the board. All this information is useful, as in this way you will get a better understanding of which terms are good and which bad, how good or bad a certain term is, be able to follow real-game examples and deduce everything about the usefulness of the term. As already observed, you will not find a more COMPREHENSIVE GUIDE on chess/chess evaluation than this one. The main asset of the book is its innovative approach and the great amount of high knowledge introduced. The book is suitable for all levels of chess, from beginner to advanced, as the approach it follows is based on pattern recognition. One just has to memorise the specific pattern featured on a diagram, and then apply it on the chess board! Nothing less, nothing more. The more terms you memorise, the better you will be at chess. MAKE NO MISTAKE: chess evaluation is the most important element in acquiring a better chess knowledge. You can play very good chess by being able to evaluate well, even if you are not able to calculate all lines very well, but the opposite is not quite true. If you don't know which positions are good and which bad, you will always be choosing the bad ones! So, don't wait any longer, and just grab this UNIQUE chess knowledge guide, memorise all patterns inside and progress at chess much faster than you have ever thought possible.",$16.79,3.5

Wilson Literary Science Writing Award   Over the past two decades of neurological research, it has become increasingly clear that the way we experience the world--our perception, behavior, memory, and social judgment--is largely driven by the mind's subliminal processes and not by the conscious ones, as we have long believed. In Subliminal, Leonard Mlodinow employs his signature concise, accessible explanations of the most obscure scientific subjects to unravel the complexities of the subliminal mind. In the process he shows the many ways it influences how we misperceive our relationships with family, friends, and business associates; how we misunderstand the reasons for our investment decisions; and how we misremember important events--along the way, changing our view of ourselves and the world around us.",$10.87,4.4

Today the mind-body problem confronts not only metaphysicians and moral philosophers, but also workers in the fields of cognitive science, artificial intelligence and neuroscience. Paul Marshall offers a radical solution to the mind-body problem by rejecting the idea of a purely material world and asserting instead the primacy of experience. As many have recognized before, experience is not reducible to material bodies and processes alone. Marshall goes a step further and suggests that the matter investigated by modern science corresponds to structural features of an experiential universe that supports and includes our familiar experiences. Utilizing clues furnished by mystical experience and responding to a challenge posed by the physics of motion, Marshall takes up Leibniz's philosophy of 'living mirrors' and arrives at a holistic world-picture that has suggestive links with quantum physics and the visionary cosmologies of East and West.",$20.67,

Some came from conservative and religious families, others were progressive and secular; some had spent time in jail. They were shy and uncomfortable at first, unaccustomed to being asked to speak their minds, but soon they removed their veils and began to speak more freely–their stories intertwining with the novels they were reading by Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Henry James, and Vladimir Nabokov. As Islamic morality squads staged arbitrary raids in Tehran, as fundamentalists seized hold of the universities and a blind censor stifled artistic expression, the women in Nafisi’s living room spoke not only of the books they were reading but also about themselves, their dreams and disappointments.Azar Nafisi’s luminous masterwork gives us a rare glimpse, from the inside, of women’s lives in revolutionary Iran.

43481,395925037,book,paperback,Mein Kampf,"Adolf Hitler, Ralph Manheim",Houghton Mifflin Company," In 1922, just four years after the war to end all wars, an unknown Austrian then living in Bavaria planned a pamphlet to be called Settling Accounts. In it he intended to attack the ineffectiveness of the dominant political parties in Germany which were opposed to the new National Socialists (Nazis). In November 1923, Adolf Hitler was jailed for the abortive Munich Beer Hall putsch along with men willing and able to assist him with his writing. With the help of these collaborators, chief among them Rudolf Hess, the pamphlet became a book. Settling Accounts became Mein Kampf, an unparalleled example of muddled economics and history, appalling bigotry, and an intense self-glorification of Adolf Hitler as the true founder and builder of the National Socialist movement. It was written in hate and it contained a blueprint for violent bloodshed. When Mein Kampf was published in 1925, it was a failure. In 1926 a second volume appeared - it was no more successful than the first. People either laughed at it or ignored it. They were wrong to do so. As Hitler's power increased, pressure was put on all party members to buy the book. Gradually this pressure was extended to all elements of the German population. Soon Mein Kampf was even being passed out to newlywed couples as a gift. Ironically, and frighteningly, by the time Hitler came to power on January 30, 1933, what has been considered by many to be the most satanic book ever written was running neck and neck with the Bible at the top of the German bestseller lists. In his excellent introduction to this definitive American translation of Mein Kampf, Konrad Heiden writes: ""For years Mein Kampf stood as proof of the blindness and complacency of the world. For in its pages Hitler announced -- long before he came to power -- a program of blood and terror in a self-revelation of such overwhelming frankness that few among its readers had the courage to believe it ... That such a man could go so far toward realizing his ambitions, and -- above all -- could find millions of willing tools and helpers; that is a phenomenon the world will ponder for centuries to come."" We would be wrong in thinking that such a program, such a man, and such appalling consequences could not reappear in our world of the present. We cannot permit our selves the luxury of forgetting the tragedy of World War II or the man who, more than any other, fostered it. Mein Kampf must be read and constantly remembered as a specimen of evil demagoguery that people whenever men grow tired of thinking and acting for themselves. Mein Kampf is a blueprint for the age of chaos. It transcends in historical importance any other book of the present generation. In his translation Ralph Manheim has taken particular care to give an exact English equivalent of Hitler's highly individual, and often awkward style, including his occasional grammatical errors. We believe this book should stand as the complete, final, and definitive English version of Hitler's own story of his life, his political philosophy, and his thwarted plans for world domination. Translated by Ralph Manheim with an introduction by Konrad Heiden. A compilation of Hitler's most famous prison writings of 1923--the bible of National Socialism and the blueprint for the Third Reich.",$20.98,4.0

How many will there be? And who will have them? As technology continues to accelerate and machines begin taking care of themselves, fewer people will be necessary. Artificial intelligence is already well on its way to making ""good jobs"" obsolete: many paralegals, journalists, office workers, and even computer programmers are poised to be replaced by robots and smart software. As progress continues, blue and white collar jobs alike will evaporate, squeezing working- and middle-class families ever further. At the same time, households are under assault from exploding costs, especially from the two major industries-education and health care-that, so far, have not been transformed by information technology. The result could well be massive unemployment and inequality as well as the implosion of the consumer economy itself.The past solutions to technological disruption, especially more training and education, aren't going to work. We must decide, now, whether the future will see broad-based prosperity or catastrophic levels of inequality and economic insecurity.

Its inhabitants believe unquestioningly in their own sanctity. But in Arthur Miller's edgy masterpiece, that very belief will have poisonous consequences when a vengeful teenager accuses a rival of witchcraft—and then when those accusations multiply to consume the entire village.

It is a play that is not only relentlessly suspenseful and vastly moving but that compels readers to fathom their hearts and consciences in ways that only the greatest theater ever can.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Moroz," • Is your to-do list never ending? • Do you feel like life has lost a little of its flavour? • Do you feel stuck in a relationship, job, or another life pursuit? • Are your achievements not as fulfilling as you’d hoped they’d be? If you said yes to any of these questions, you may have fallen into the “persistence trap”—persisting for persistence sake. The solution may just be to take a break, or even to say, “I quit!” But how do you know when it is time for a break in your life? How do you know when it is time to pull the plug? In this minimalist self-help guide, personal coach and counsellor Moroz, warns about the dangers of persistence and the importance of taking pause, breaks, and quitting. You’ve no doubt heard much about the power of persistence and perseverance, but little about The Art of Graceful Quitting, going with the flow, and having a life of rhythm. In Persistence is Futile Stacy Moroz presents much of his research into ancient and current thinking on persistence. He presents many of the solutions he has found from various sources—health, philosophy, business, psychology, and more. He argues that in many cases, by choosing persistence—you are often taking the long and painful road to success. Why not take a shortcut? Read this book to discover: • Why persistence isn’t giving you the results you expected. • How to avoid the “Persistence Trap”. • Tricks, tweaks, and hacks for living a life of rhythm and flow. • Why some of the happiest and most successful people are quitters. • How quickness and the ability to change trump persistence and perseverance. • How to feel like you are really living again and Master the Art of Graceful Quitting.",$14.99,5.0

Society, politics and culture have worked together to create a situation where parents are presented with a ‘choice' – breast or bottle? Such a ‘choice' implies that the product (the milk) and the method of delivery (breast or bottle) are equal, but is this true?In many countries bottle-feeding has become so common that it is never questioned, and indeed is often seen as the answer to parents' problems. Not sleeping at night? Not enough milk? Mum needs medication? Reach for the formula. Every day women are told by their friends, family and even their doctors that bottle-feeding is the answer. Yet research shows that most mothers want to breastfeed, and that babies who are not breastfed are at increased risk of illness.Why Breastfeeding Matters tackles some of these issues head-on, in a frank discussion intended to help parents and others navigate the world of infant feeding. It is neither preachy nor a ‘how-to' manual; it outlines some of the reasons why breastfeeding matters, to mothers and their babies, and explains how this can affect the way in which mothers use bottles and formula if they need to. Drawing on research, and the author's experience as a lactation consultant, it is essential reading for anyone wondering about how to feed their new baby.",$12.95,

But although Jack is a normal child in many ways - loving, funny, bright, full of energy and questions - his upbringing is far from ordinary: Jack's entire life has been spent in a single room that measures just 12 feet by 12 feet; as far as he's concerned, Room is the entire world.

There's TV too, of course - and the cartoon characters he thinks of as his friends - but Jack knows that nothing else he sees on the screen is real. Old Nick, on the other hand, is all too real, but only visits at night - like a bat - when Jack is meant to be asleep and hidden safely in Wardrobe. And only Old Nick has the code to Door, which is otherwise locked...Told in Jack's voice, ""Room"" is the story of a mother's love for her son, and of a young boy's innocence.

After being held for five days in appalling conditions in the Vélodrome d'Hiver stadium, Joseph and his family were transported by cattle car to the Beaune-la-Rolande internment camp and brutally separated: all the adults and most of the children were transported on to Auschwitz and certain death, but 1,000 children were left behind to wait for a later train. The French guards told the children left behind that they would soon be reunited with their parents, but Joseph and his new friend, Joe Kogan, chose to risk everything in a daring escape attempt.

She once considered herself unmotivated by the lure of prosperity, but upon being called “rich” by an undeniably poor child, evidence to the contrary mounted, and a social experiment turned spiritual was born.7 is the true story of how Jen (along with her husband and her children to varying degrees) took seven months, identified seven areas of excess, and made seven simple choices to fight back against the modern-day diseases of greed, materialism, and overindulgence.Food. Clothes. Spending. Media. Possessions. Waste. Stress. They would spend thirty days on each topic, boiling it down to the number seven.

Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the second book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the third book was written at Carnuntum.

He becomes so wrapped up with the work and its unusual author that, soon, his previously placid life begins to come unraveled. As Aomame’s and Tengo’s narratives converge over the course of this single year, we learn of the profound and tangled connections that bind them ever closer: a beautiful, dyslexic teenage girl with a unique vision; a mysterious religious cult that instigated a shoot-out with the metropolitan police; a reclusive, wealthy dowager who runs a shelter for abused women; a hideously ugly private investigator; a mild-mannered yet ruthlessly efficient bodyguard; and a peculiarly insistent television-fee collector.A love story, a mystery, a fantasy, a novel of self-discovery, a dystopia to rival George Orwell’s—1Q84 is Haruki Murakami’s most ambitious undertaking yet: an instant best seller in his native Japan, and a tremendous feat of imagination from one of our most revered contemporary writers.",$16.20,4.0

These deaths did not escape the attention of the sensitive girl, and she’ll be forever haunted by the faces of those who died. Her parents and her sister did not survive the family’s attempt to escape the ghetto, but despite her loss, Krystyna struggled to stay alive; she was hiding in order to save her life, she faced hunger, thirst, fear for her life. Nevertheless, Providence has chosen for her to live, to be. More than a memoir, The Strange Ways of Providence in my Life, gives the reader a piece of history.The book contains more than 100 photos, taken by Krystyna’s father, a professional photographer, who sent them to his family in Israel before the war. In the book, you will also find amazing photos of the members of the Jewish community, drowned in the Dniester river by Ukrainians few years later.Doctor Markus Willbach, a friend of Krystyna’s family, an adult at that time, depicts an account that emphasizes the authenticity of Krystyna Carmi’s memories as a little girl. His account of the events is part of the book. This powerful memoir will leave you breathless and heartbroken, yet, inspired. A must read!

Woodward,Touchstone," From inside the Vatican, the book that became a modern classic on sainthood in the Catholic Church.  Working from church documents, Kenneth Woodward shows how saint-makers decide who is worthy of the church's highest honor. He describes the investigations into lives of candidates, explains how claims for miracles are approved or rejected, and reveals the role politics -- papal and secular -- plays in the ultimate decision. From his examination of such controversial candidates as Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador and Edith Stein, a Jewish philosopher who became a nun and was gassed at Auschwitz, to his insights into the changes Pope John Paul II has instituted, Woodward opens the door on a 2,000-year-old tradition.",$21.50,4.3

Others fear the same fate as they struggle to resist old temptations and habits. We blame God, as though He didn't save us completely. When doubts come to the surface, we feel it's impossible to stay a faithful Christian. The truth is, the spiritual warfare you experience is not because you are not free. You're attacked because you are free. You are now a threat to the darkness, so the opposition increases. The enemy knows you are instrumental in spreading the gospel and in advancing God's kingdom. It is possible to stay in the light and never go back into the darkness. As the Bible says in John 8:36, ""If the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed"" (MEV). Sophia Ruffin uses her personal experience of overcoming homosexuality, rage, bitterness, and so much more to bring you the tools and strategies to maintain your deliverance. Put on the armor of the Lord, and develop a proactive strategy to overthrow the enemy's agenda. Set Free and Delivered features prayers, confessions, and Ruffin's inspiring testimony to prepare you for the battles that come after giving your life to God.  ",$11.74,4.9

Then someone begins to impersonate Paul online, and he watches in horror as a website, a Facebook page, and a Twitter account are created in his name.

43588,098718606X,book,paperback,Mamotte wa ikenai himitsu ga aru (Japanese Edition),"Ms Jayneen Sanders, Mr Craig Smith",UpLoad Educate2Empower PublishingPty Ltd," 'Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept' is a beautifully illustrated children's picture book that sensitively broaches the subject of keeping children safe from inappropriate touch. We teach water and road safety, but how do we teach Body Safety to young children in a way that is neither frightening nor confronting? This book is an invaluable tool for parents, caregivers, teachers and healthcare professionals to broach the subject of safe and unsafe touch in a non-threatening and age-appropriate way. The comprehensive notes to the reader and discussion questions at the back of the book support both the reader and the child when discussing the story. Suitable for children aged 3 to 12 years.Story is a great medium to discuss difficult topics. 'Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept' was written to ensure children are armed with knowledge if they are ever touched inappropriately; and from the first unsafe touch, a child will understand to tell a trusted adult and keep on telling until they are believed. It is an important book and one that all children need to hear. Forewarned is forearmed! This book is supported by free activities and child protection resources on our website. 'Some Secrets Should Never Be Kept' is available in 7 languages including English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, Italian and French.Body Safety Education (also known as protective behaviours or child sexual abuse prevention education) involves so much more than focusing on stranger danger. In fact, 95% of sexually abused children will know their abuser and only 5% will be strangers. It is also crucial for children to learn that they must never keep secrets that make them feel bad or uncomfortable (in fact, we teach it's best not to have secrets in families, only happy surprises). The trouble with secrets is that they are the main tool used by child molesters to ensure children remain silent about the abuse. Ensuring the secret is kept is of utmost importance to the perpetrator. Therefore, threats and insisting no-one will believe the child is used as a way of controlling the child to be silent. Through Body Safety Education parents and children will learn the importance of there being no secrets between us. Parents and carers need to be on the lookout for signs of sexual abuse in children and grooming behaviour which is often focused on themselves as well as their children. The answer to the question, 'How do I keep kids safe from sexual abuse?' is simple; teach them Body Safety Education from a very young age. Always use the correct names for their genitals, ensure they know that the parts covered by their swimsuit are known as their private parts, and that private means 'just for you', and consequently not for sharing. This is known as the swimsuit lesson. When you teach your child that 'your body belongs to you' you are empowering them with confidence through knowledge.Body Safety Education also involves teaching your child that no-one can touch their private parts, and if they do, they must tell a trusted adult until believed.Kids need to be safe as well as feel safe. Teaching a child that private means 'just for you' and that their private parts are found under their swimsuit is a valuable lesson that can prevent child molestation. The sexual abuse of children is regrettably very common. Approximately 1 in 3 girls and 1 in 6 boys will be sexually abused before their 18th birthday. You can help stop child abuse by teaching social and physical boundaries to kids and that some parts are not for sharing. A child needs be able to proclaim loudly and with conviction that, 'My body belongs to me', 'I am the boss of my body' and that 'From my head to my toes, I say what goes'. Please note: the author uses 'safe and unsafe touch' or 'inappropriate touch' as preferred terms for good and bad touch which may be confusing for a child as bad touch (inappropriate touch) can often feel good, i.e. be pleasurable and this can cause confusion for a child.",$14.95,

The theological foundation espoused here, as well as the numerous practical helps that are included, will help any servant of the Lord to point the hearts and minds of the bereaved to the 'man of sorrows' who is 'acquainted with grief' (Isaiah 53:3).The Practical Shepherding series of booklets provides pastors and ministry leaders with advice and practical help to do the work of pastoral ministry in a local church.  In Comfort Those Who Grieve, experienced pastor Paul Tautges offers readers a guide to comforting those dealing with death through the hope of the gospel.  ",$9.55,4.8

43594,1494279630,book,paperback,101 Fiction Writing Tips,Quentin Cope,CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," Fiction writing is thought by many would be authors to be the most popular published genre and therefore perhaps the best to be aiming at when considering a writing career. Current best estimates are that in 2016, published books will double in number from all of those in existence at the end of 2011. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to get two knowledgeable individuals to agree on what that figure is in reality. However, one reasonably sound statistic is the percentage of fiction and non-fiction publications now produced annually in the English language. The current estimates are around 30% for fiction and 70% for non-fiction. So, the lesson to learn there then, is that you may stand a considerably better chance of success as a writer by putting together a book of your grandmother’s best apple pie secrets than attempting the possibly thankless task of coming face to face with the prospect of writing a novel … a work of fiction … a work of fantasy, a work that will need to find a particular audience. This book is not an answer to that quandary and neither does it offer any form of guarantee to you as a potential author. What is does provide however, is a list of 101 tips of advice and reference to the writer who simply wants’ to ‘get on with the job!’ These offerings are provided from personal experience of both the self-publishing and traditional publishing routes. They are collected together in this short book format with the sole aim of supplying you, the potential writer of fantastic fiction, with a series of easy to absorb statements and explanations written in a language that is uncomplicated and to the point. Hopefully, some or much of it will afford you the help and assistance you may be looking for and therefore energize you in the pursuit of your writing projects. Good Luck ….",$8.99,

43685,161278724X,book,paperback,Transforming Parish Communications: Growing the Church Through New Media,Scot Landry,Our Sunday Visitor," From the Foreword written by Cardinal Seán O'Malley, Archbishop of Boston""In this book, Scot Landry explains why it is critical for parishes, as hubs of the New Evangelization, to embrace new media. He indicates what the essential new media tools are for parishes today, shares practical strategies for how to implement them, and describes how these tools can transform parish communications. I am confident that Scot s practical wisdom, passion for evangelization, and enthusiasm for new media will help parish leaders overcome any hesitancy about embracing these new methods. We would like all parishes to have a program for engaging those on the digital continent and leading them to be transformed by the grace of the Sacraments and the love of the Christian community within the Church.""""Are we still a Church capable of warming hearts? A Church capable of leading people back to Jerusalem? Of bringing them home?"" - Pope Francis, Meeting with the Bishops of Brazil, 28 July 2013.Pope Francis, like his predecessors Benedict XVI and John Paul II, is calling for Catholics to embrace the new evangelization. But there has been ongoing confusion about who is responsible, what it really means and what it looks like in practical application. How can we respond to the Holy Father's call, creating evangelization opportunities that help bring people back to the Church?By transforming Catholics into digital missionaries - ready and able to take the joy and warmth of the Gospel online via social media to infrequent, inactive, or ex-Catholics around the corner or across the globe.Consider this:1. Nearly every ""lost"" Catholic in the U.S. is most likely connected with at least one engaged Catholic - or is one ""retweet"" or ""like"" away from them2. On the whole, Catholics have not been taught to see social media as a way to live out their faith3. Motivating parishes to put a priority on evangelization has been a challenge4. Catholics are more likely to be comfortable as digital missionaries than to participate in other forms of evangelization5. Parishes can offer ""digital missionary training"" to parishioners - who would welcome it!In Transforming Parish Communications: Growing the Church Through New Media, you'll discover:How to embrace the Church's vision of evangelization in new mediaHow entire parishes can become hubs of digital evangelization - and how to overcome obstaclesSpecific strategies for implementationHow to create a consistent digital identity onlineBest practices for parish websitesThe nuts and bolts of Facebook, Twitter, email, blogging and moreConsider this book your entry into an important - and urgent - call to each of us as Catholics.

He even admits to collaborating with Napoleon’s troops. And Elizabeth Bennet despises all traitors. But she can’t make sense of Darcy. He doesn’t act like a traitor. He risks his own safety to save young women from the French. And how can she despise a man who loves puppies? Something about him doesn’t add up – and she finds him far too attractive. Then Darcy’s carefully constructed world crumbles, and he must entrust his closest-held secret to Elizabeth. To protect that secret, Elizabeth must disappear entirely, leaving her family and Darcy behind, to plunge herself into the dizzying world of fashionable London and the dangers of the Loyalist Resistance. Nothing will ever be the same again. Darcy is determined to find Elizabeth. Now that she knows the truth about him, there’s nothing to keep them apart – nothing, that is, until the day Darcy is forced to choose between his country and the life of the woman he loves…",$15.99,4.6

43691,141034645,book,paperback,The Better Angels of Our Nature: A History of Violence and Humanity,Stephen Pinker,Penguin Books," This title is shortlisted for the samuel johnson prize 2012. This acclaimed book by steven pinker, author of ""the language instinct"" and ""the blank slate"", argues that, contrary to popular belief, humankind has become progressively less violent, over millenia and decades. Can violence really have declined? the images of conflict we see daily on our screens from around the world suggest this is an almost obscene claim to be making. Extraordinarily, however, steven pinker shows violence within and between societies - both murder and warfare - really has declined from prehistory to today.we are much less likely to die at someone else's hands than ever before. Even the horrific carnage of the last century, when compared to the dangers of pre - state societies, is part of this trend. Debunking both the idea of the 'noble savage' and an over - simplistic hobbesian notion of a 'nasty, brutish and short' life, steven pinker argues that modernity and its cultural institutions are actually making us better people. ""one of the most important books i've read - not just this yearbut ever...for me, what's most important about ""the better angels of our nature"" are its insights into how to help achieve positive outcomes.how can we encourage a less violent, more just society, particularly for the poor? steven pinker shows us ways we can make those positive trajectories a little more likely. That's a contribution, not just to historical scholarshipbut to the world"". (bill gates). ""brilliant, mind - altering...everyone should read this astonishing book"". (david runciman, ""guardian""). ""a supremely important book. To have command of so much research, spread across so many different fields, is a masterly achievement. Pinker convincingly demonstrates that there has been a dramatic decline in violence and he is persuasive about the causes of that decline"". (peter singer, ""new york times"").",$13.79,4.4
43692,1897238460,book,paperback,The Presence Process: A Journey into Present Moment Awareness,Michael Brown,Namaste Publishing," Why is it so difficult to respond consciously when we are upset? Why do we instead resort to hurtful, repetitive, unconscious, reactive behaviors?The reason is that we all have deeply suppressed emotional imprints that are programmed into us through experience and other's example. This imprinting unfolds automatically throughout the first seven years of childhood. Until these emotional charges are consciously identified and integrated, whenever upset, like programmed organic machinery, we automatically resort to these reactive behaviors.The Presence Process invites us to aspire to 'conscious emotional response' as a way of life. Reading and applying the simple procedure in this book makes it possible for anyone, anywhere, to transform the quality of their life experience from one of uncontrollable re-activity, to deliberate responsibility.We all long to be free of our emotional outbursts and to rather experience inner calm responsiveness in the face of difficulty. What The Presence Process reveals through direct experience is that any attempt on our behalf to 'get rid of' our emotional discomfort is misguided. Rather, it experientially reveals to us the miraculous transformation that unfolds when we instead embrace conscious emotional responsibility. The Presence Process is a guided, self-facilitated journey into taking full responsibility for our emotional condition. It is a step-by-step path for the unhappy child within us to grow up emotionally.",$13.56,4.7

While on patrol one foggy March evening, Bowditch receives a call for help. A woman has reportedly struck a deer on a lonely coast road. When the game warden arrives on the scene, he finds blood in the road―but both the driver and the deer have vanished. And the state trooper assigned to the accident appears strangely unconcerned.  The details of the disappearance seem eerily familiar. Seven years earlier, a jury convicted lobsterman Erland Jefferts of the rape and murder of a wealthy college student and sentenced him to life in prison. For all but his most fanatical defenders, justice was served. But when the missing woman is found brutalized in a manner that suggests Jefferts may have been framed, Bowditch receives an ominous warning from state prosecutors to stop asking questions. For Bowditch, whose own life was recently shattered by a horrific act of violence, doing nothing is not an option. His clandestine investigation reopens old wounds between Maine locals and rich summer residents and puts both his own life and that of the woman he loves in jeopardy. As he closes in on his quarry, he suddenly discovers how dangerous his opponents are, and how far they will go to prevent him from bringing a killer to justice.",$9.27,4.3

Alger Prize, International Studies AssociationThe Trouble with the Congo suggests a new explanation for international peacebuilding failures in civil wars. Drawing from more than 330 interviews and a year and a half of field research, it develops a case study of the international intervention during the Democratic Republic of the Congo's unsuccessful transition from war to peace and democracy (2003-2006). Grassroots rivalries over land, resources, and political power motivated widespread violence. However, a dominant peacebuilding culture shaped the intervention strategy in a way that precluded action on local conflicts, ultimately dooming the international efforts to end the deadliest conflict since World War II. Most international actors interpreted continued fighting as the consequence of national and regional tensions alone. UN staff and diplomats viewed intervention at the macro levels as their only legitimate responsibility. The dominant culture constructed local peacebuilding as such an unimportant, unfamiliar, and unmanageable task that neither shocking events nor resistance from select individuals could convince international actors to reevaluate their understanding of violence and intervention.",$22.93,4.2

It is set in the fictional town of Winesburg, Ohio, which is based loosely on the author's childhood memories. Mostly written from late 1915 to early 1916, with a few stories completed closer to publication, they were “...conceived as complementary parts of a whole, centered in the background of a single community.” (Phillips) The book consists of twenty-two stories, with the first story, “The Book of the Grotesque”, serving as an introduction. Each of the stories shares a specific character's past and present struggle to overcome the loneliness and isolation that seems to permeate the town. Stylistically, because of its emphasis on the psychological insights of characters over plot, and plain-spoken prose, Winesburg, Ohio is known as one of the earliest works of Modernist literature. Winesburg, Ohio was received well by critics despite some reservations about its moral tone and unconventional storytelling. Though its reputation waned in the 1930s, it has since rebounded and is now considered one of the most influential portraits of pre-industrial small-town life in the United States and is considered one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.",$9.95,3.8

And each in turn discovers that the surest pathway to happiness lies not in surrender to the sham, but in resistance."" ~Heidi Hess-Saxton, author of Behold Your Mother""The festering underbelly of the Cathar movement and the clash between two rival faiths in thirteenth-century France make this novel very interesting, very enjoyable and...one of the most intriguing takes on religious controversies of the Middle Ages.

The stories artfully illuminate the rich interconnections and clashes that occur as her characters strike out boldly, yet find themselves at the mercy of capricious waves of circumstance.Stone Baby explores movement, loss, and reinvention in the lives of people who are in the wrong place, in the wrong body, perhaps in the wrong life—it encapsulates an engrossing and urgent message in our age of migration and dislocation. ",$13.18,3.0

Isaacson’s portrait touched millions of readers. At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering. Although Jobs cooperated with the author, he asked for no control over what was written. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. He himself spoke candidly about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues offer an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.",$12.99,4.4

These five statements summarize much of what the Reformation was about, and they distinguish Protestantism from other expressions of the Christian faith. Protestants place ultimate and final authority in the Scriptures, acknowledge the work of Christ alone as sufficient for redemption, recognize that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone, and seek to do all things for God’s glory.In God’s Glory Alone—The Majestic Heart of Christian Faith and Life, renowned scholar David VanDrunen looks at the historical and biblical roots of the idea that all glory belongs to God alone. He examines the development of this theme in the Reformation, in subsequent Reformed theology and confessions, and in contemporary theologians who continue to be inspired by the conviction that all glory belongs to God. Then he turns to the biblical story of God's glory, beginning with the pillar of cloud and fire revealed to Israel, continuing through the incarnation, death, and exaltation of the Lord Jesus Christ, and culminating in Christ's Second Coming and the glorification of his people. In light of these wonderful biblical themes he concludes by addressing several of today's great cultural challenges and temptations—such as distraction and narcissism—and reflecting on how commitment to God's glory alone fortifies us to live godly lives in this present evil age.",$11.55,4.0

Anderson,Regnery Publishing," The Supreme Court has issued a decision, but that doesn't end the debate. Now that the Supreme Court has ruled, Americans face momentous debates about the nature of marriage and religious liberty. Because the Court has redefined marriage in all 50 states, we have to energetically protect our freedom to live according to conscience and faith as we work to rebuild a strong marriage culture.In the first book to respond to the Supreme Court's decision on same-sex marriage, Ryan Anderson draws on the best philosophy and social science to explain what marriage is, why it matters for public policy, and the consequences of its legal redefinition.Attacks on religious liberty--predicated on the bogus equation of opposition to same-sex marriage with racism--have already begun, and modest efforts in Indiana and other states to protect believers' rights have met with hysterics from media and corporate elites. Anderson tells the stories of innocent citizens who have been coerced and penalized by the government and offers a strategy to protect the natural right of religious liberty.Anderson reports on the latest research on same-sex parenting, filling it out with the testimony of children raised by gays and lesbians. He closes with a comprehensive roadmap on how to rebuild a culture of marriage, with work to be done by everyone.The nation's leading defender of marriage in the media and on university campuses, Ryan Anderson has produced the must-read manual on where to go from here. There are reasonable and compelling arguments for the truth about marriage, but too many of our neighbors haven't heard them.

Then put them in a time and place that encourages artistic creativity, excessive drinking and some rather outrageous behavior. Lastly, give them national exposure. What emerges is a group that not only sets the standard for contemporary literary style and wit, but helps change forever the face of American culture. This collection contains the early poems, stories and anecdotes from seven of the Algonquin Round Table writers: Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Franklin Pierce Adams, Heywood Broun, Edna Ferber, Ruth Hale, and Donald Ogden Stewart.",$14.95,3.9

Houck, Joseph Delbert Da",Southern Illinois University Press," Not afraid to tackle provocative topics in American culture, from gun violence and labor policies to terrorism and health care, Michael Moore has earned both applause and invective in his career as a documentarian. In such polarizing films as Bowling for Columbine, Fahrenheit 9/11, and Sicko, Moore has established a unique voice of radical nostalgia for progressivism, and in doing so has become one of the most recognized documentary filmmakers of all time. In the first in-depth study of Moore’s feature-length documentary films, editors Thomas W. Benson and Brian J. Snee have gathered leading rhetoric scholars to examine the production, rhetorical appeals, and audience reception of these films. Contributors critique the films primarily as modes of public argument and political art. Each essay is devoted to one of Moore’s films and traces in detail how each film invites specific audience responses. Michael Moore and the Rhetoric of Documentary reveals not only the art, the argument, and the emotional appeals of Moore’s documentaries but also how these films have revolutionized the genre of documentary filmmaking.

Ferguson Award, International Studies Association- Honorable mention, 2015 Chadwick F. Alger Prize, International Studies Association- Honorable mention, 2014 Book of the Year, African ArgumentsThis book suggests a new explanation for why international peace interventions often fail to reach their full potential. Based on several years of ethnographic research in conflict zones around the world, it demonstrates that everyday elements - such as the expatriates' social habits and usual approaches to understanding their areas of operation - strongly influence peacebuilding effectiveness. Individuals from all over the world and all walks of life share numerous practices, habits, and narratives when they serve as interveners in conflict zones. These common attitudes and actions enable foreign peacebuilders to function in the field, but they also result in unintended consequences that thwart international efforts. Certain expatriates follow alternative modes of thinking and acting, often with notable results, but they remain in the minority. Through an in-depth analysis of the interveners' everyday life and work, this book proposes innovative ways to better help host populations build a sustainable peace.",$28.48,5.0

His enormous mother, once the town sweetheart, has been eating nonstop ever since her husband's suicide, and the floor beneath her TV chair is threatening to cave in. Gilbert's long-suffering older sister, Amy, still mourns the death of Elvis, and his knockout younger sister has become hooked on makeup, boys, and Jesus -- in that order. But the biggest event on the horizon for all the Grapes is the eighteenth birthday of Gilbert's younger brother, Arnie, who is a living miracle just for having survived so long. As the Grapes gather in Endora, a mysterious beauty glides through town on a bicycle and rides circles around Gilbert, until he begins to see a new vision of his family and himself....  With this wry portrait of small-town Iowa -- and a young man's life at the crossroads -- Peter Hedges created a classic American novel ""charged with sardonic intelligence"" (Washington Post Book World).",$13.60,4.3

Having stretched avoidance to its limits, it's time to come clean--a terrifying prospect since her mother is sure to blame her rather than her cheating, emotionally frigid ex. A couple of drinks and two Dramamine later, Megan finds herself spilling her sob story to the tall, dark, and handsome stranger in the seat next to her. With only one week left to save his business, Josh McMillan boards a plane to Kansas City in a last-ditch effort, leaving the details to chance. An unexpected answer is delivered in the form of the beautiful brunette beside him. Though she’s completely loopy, her honesty, openness, and humor charm him. So when she passes out before landing, he helps her off the plane--a good deed that leads to a colossal misunderstanding. Her parents assume he’s her fiancé. In a twist of fate, the mix-up might help Josh save his business, so he plays along, figuring he can help Megan too. All he has to do is stage a public break up convincing enough to appease her mother. Josh is only supposed to be a substitute groom, but the more time he and Megan spend together, the more their pretend engagement starts to feel real…and the less they want to break it off. Can a relationship that began as a farce turn into happily ever after?",$13.99,4.4

Hunnicutt,Echo Point Books & Media," In Stuart: A History of the American Light Tank (Vol. I), Richard Hunnicutt outlines the development history of the American light tank and its associated self-propelled guns and support vehicles.Beginning with the modification of the French Renault in the midst of WWI, Stuart covers all pre-Stuart vehicles active during WWI in addition to light tank models and variations active during WWII, with emphasis on the wartime development of M3, M5, and M24 series of light tanks. A few other vehicles that are not technically light tanks, such as the M18 and LVT, also receive attention here as they share a number of key characteristics with the Stuart. In this comprehensive history, Hunnicutt also touches on postwar modifications and service of vehicles developed during WWII.In addition to detailing nearly all aspects of technical data and specifications, Stuart features images on nearly every page: photographs, full-color plates, line drawings, and cutaway diagrams, many of which are rare interior shots and diagrams from technical manuals. While Hunnicutt leaves the writing of the complete combat history of the Stuart to those who manned them in battle, he includes some of the Stuart's actions to demonstrate its uses in combat and attributes, both positive and negative.The definitive reference tome for the military historian, professional soldier, and tank restorer, Stuart remains the most comprehensive history on the American light tank's development from its beginnings through WWII.Richard Pearce Hunnicutt (1926-2011) enlisted in the 7th Infantry Division in 1944 and in 1945 was promoted to sergeant and awarded the Silver Star for his heroic actions. After WWII, Hunnicutt earned a Masters in engineering from Stanford University under the GI Bill. In addition to being one of the most respected metallurgists in California, Hunnicutt wrote the definitive 10-volume history of the development and employment of American armored vehicles. As a tank historian and leading expert in the field, Hunnicutt was one of the founders of the US Army Ordnance Museum at Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD and was a close friend and frequent contributor to the Patton Museum at Fort Knox, KY.",$69.95,3.8

43923,306807920,book,paperback,Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising And The 1960s,Gerald Horne,Da Capo Press," In August 1965 the predominantly black neighborhood of Watts in Los Angeles erupted in flames and violence following an incident of police brutality. The official death toll was thirty-four; property losses reached hundreds of millions of dollars; but the political results were even more profound. The civil rights movement was placed on the defensive as the image of rioting blacks in the West replaced the image of meek and angelic protestors in the South. A white backlash ensued that led directly to Ronald Reagan's election as governor of California in 1966.This is the first comprehensive treatment of the uprising, its causes, and its aftermath, and is based on hundreds of oral histories and unprecedented archival research. With a cast that includes Ronald Reagan, Tom Bradley, Martin Luther King, Jr., Edmund G. Brown, the NAACP, the Black Panthers, the Nation of Islam, and thousands of blacks and whites, Fire This Time is a compelling account of an event that changed the face of racial justice in America.",$18.36,3.6

43974,1856230465,book,paperback,The Alternative Kitchen Garden: An A-Z,Emma Cooper,Permanent Publications," The Alternative Kitchen Garden is an evolving idea of what a kitchen garden could be in the twenty-first century: organic, environmentally sustainable, resilient, and about localizing at least some of our food production. It’s also a place not only for learning and practicing growing skills but also for enjoying ourselves and having fun. The Alternative Kitchen Garden is the ideal companion for anyone getting dirt under their fingernails for the first time and full of fascinating ideas and experiments for the adventurous gardener. A self-confessed “cyber geek,” Emma documents the transformation of her “ropey old lawn with potholes and brambles” into a fertile and abundant permaculture plot via Internet radio and a popular blog site. Eight years of her postings and stories have been collected in here, illustrated with beautiful color photographs and arranged into easily accessible alphabetical order. The Alternative Kitchen Garden: An A-Z covers subjects as diverse as growing achocha (a forgotten Incan crop) to zucchinis. Emma’s style, is light and friendly, yet at the same time informative and based on personal experience—you feel you could actually be sitting in the garden chatting face to face as she shares her knowledge and experience.",,4.0

43976,1513608266,book,paperback,Soapbox-Momster: Cyber Stalker of the Abyss (Cyber Thrillers),Don Allen Holbrook,Two Knights One Horse Publishing," Those that have lost everything may feel that finding their hunter and tormenter and making them pay is their best outlet for their embarrassment and for their loss of social position and their very ability to make a living.  They can also hunt their hunter and tormenter only in the real world so they may see the lack of a legal system for protection from these tormenters as a reason that justifies their own actions to silence their tormenters permanently.  Human nature has always taught us kill or be killed.  The taking of anothers life is not so hard, but to murder someone and pull off the perfect murder, one where you don't ever get caught, now that is much more difficult.  Could you pull off the perfect murder and not get caught?  Once you have lost everything many people don't feel they have much to lose by finding their tormenter and making them pay.  In this case the hunter becomes the hunted and the former hunter becomes the prey.  The legal system is woefully behind in policing the internet and taking action to find these cyber stalkers and bullies.  The cyber vigilante's believe they are social media reporters and they use their own misguided standards as the judge of what is right and wrong from their own sick views of the world.  These cyber space trolls are ravenous now on the new platform of anonymous personas called cyber space.  They believe that the First Amendment allows them to say whatever they want about people and defame their social, professional and emotional well being, but that is not the proper understanding of the U.S. Constitution.  These comments are permanent and can destroy the entire credibility of someone in all their own real world circles built completely upon someoneelse's opinion not based upon facts, but in fact distortions of facts and on rumor mill and innuendo that is highly destructive and volatile to the vicitim forever... they are very difficult to get removed once they are posted. The real problem is that the legal system has not changed quickly enough to bring justice and restitution to victims of these cyber bullies and stalkers.  At some point the victims may become so emotional distraught that they seek the oldest form of restitution... silencing their tormenters permanently.  Murder is a crime no matter what justification the murder uses, but so is defamation and emotional tormenting a person into acting outside their sensibilities a momentary lapse of judgemento temporary insanity as we see in the media is also real.  Follow the fictional story of how some victims of a cyber space troll and blackmail artist turn the tables and pull off the perfect ultimate crime.",$13.95,4.5

Despite having just moved into a beautiful new house, the Williams family gave in to an odd, overwhelming desire to purchase and move into a Victorian home they had come upon by chance. They were curious, of course, as to why the house had, in the past, had such a high vacancy rate - no one ever seemed to live in it for a long period of time. But that curiosity didn’t last long, because shortly after moving in, strange things began to happen. It became abundantly clear that the home’s past owners had all had a reason for leaving: fear. The Williams’ new home was haunted. At first, the family tried telling themselves there were logical explanations for the strange things they all were witnessing. But before long they came to accept the fact that they were sharing their home with ghosts. Haunted is the Williams family’s story from the point of view of the mother, Dorah. Through her chilling reminiscences, we witness the all-too-real goings-on in the house. And we join the family as they seek a way to bring an end to the paranormal events that were occurring with ever more frequency and intensity, and learn why the events began in the first place.",,4.2

Butler’s fascination with this distinctly Cuban idealism sets him off on a remarkable journey, training with, befriending, and interviewing the champion boxers that Cuba seems to produce more than any other country.In the process, though, Butler gets to know the landscape of the exhilaratingly warm Cuban culture―and starts to question where he feels most at home. In the tradition of Michael Lewis and John Jeremiah Sullivan, Butler is a keen and humane storyteller, and the perfect guide for this riotous tour through the streets of Havana.",$10.87,4.4

In this bestselling book, Conor O'Clery reveals the inspiring life story of Chuck Feeney, known as the ""James Bond of philanthropy."" Feeney was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, to a blue-collar Irish-American family during the Depression. After service in the Korean War, he made a fortune as founder of Duty Free Shoppers, the world's largest duty-free retail chain. By 1988, he was hailed by Forbes Magazine as the twenty-fourth richest American alive. But secretly Feeney had already transferred all his wealth to his foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies. Only in 1997 when he sold his duty free interests, was he ""outed"" as one of the greatest and most mysterious American philanthropists in modern times, who had anonymously funded hospitals and universities from San Francisco to Limerick to New York to Brisbane. His example convinced Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to give away their fortunes during their lifetime, known as the giving pledge. ",$17.92,4.5

Jacobs, Dan Urian, Danny Kaplan, Esther Fuchs, Esther Raizen, Galeet Dardashti, Ilana Szobel, Managing Editor Karina Stern, Liav Sade-Beck, Dr. Michael Feige, Noa Roei, Philip Hollander, Philip",Wayne State University Press," The year 1978 marked Israel's entry into Lebanon, which led to the long-term military occupation of non-sovereign territory and the long, costly war in Lebanon. In the years that followed, many Israelis found themselves alienated from the idea that their country used force only when there was no alternative, and Israeli society eventually underwent a dramatic change in attitude toward militarization and the infallibility of the IDF (Israel Defense Forces). In Narratives of Dissent: War in Contemporary Israeli Arts and Culture editors Rachel S. Harris and Ranen Omer-Sherman collect nineteen essays that examine the impact of this cultural shift on Israeli visual art, music, literature, poetry, film, theatre, public broadcasting, and commemoration practices after 1978.Divided into three thematic sections-Private and Public Spaces of Commemoration and Mourning, Poetry and Prose, and Cinema and Stage-this collection presents an exciting diversity of experiences, cultural interests, and disciplinary perspectives. From the earliest wartime writings of S. Yizhar to the global phenomenon of films such as Beaufort, Waltz with Bashir, and Lebanon, the Israeli artist's imaginative and critical engagement with war and occupation has been informed by the catalysts of mourning, pain, and loss, often accompanied by a biting sense of irony. This book highlights many of the aesthetic narratives that have wielded the most profound impact on Israeli culture in the present day.These works address both incremental and radical changes in individual and collective consciousness that have spread through Israeli culture in response to the persistent affliction of war. No other such volume exists in Hebrew or English. Students and teachers of Israeli studies will appreciate Narratives of Dissent.",$19.95,5.0

44234,1937986020,book,paperback,Photographer's Guide to the Canon PowerShot S100,Alexander S. White,White Knight Press," This 283-page paperback is a complete guide to the operation and features of the Canon PowerShot S100, one of the most sophisticated compact digital cameras currently available. The book is a follow-up to earlier guides by this author to advanced compact cameras, including the Leica D-Lux 5, Panasonic Lumix LX5, and Fujifilm FinePix X100. The new book explains all operations, features, and controls of the Canon PowerShot S100 camera in clear language, providing guidance not only about how to accomplish things with the camera, but when and why to use certain features. The book does not assume specialized knowledge by the reader, but adopts a matter-of-fact tone in covering topics such as autofocus, manual focus, depth of field, aperture priority, HDR (High Dynamic Range) photography, white balance, ISO, and macro photography. The book includes discussions of the special features of the S100, including its High-Definition video capability, and its Super Slow Motion video settings, which allow the user to slow down action to one-eighth of normal speed. The more than 200 photographs in the book, almost all in full color, illustrate the controls and menus of the camera, and include examples of the types of pictures that can be taken using the many creative settings of the S100, including Creative Filters mode settings, which let the photographer alter the color processing and other aspects of images. In addition, the book explains menu options such as Dynamic Range Correction, and it explains the excellent features that this camera has for shooting continuous bursts of still photographs. The book also goes beyond the realm of everyday photography, with introductions to topics such as infrared photography, street photography, macro photography, and creating 3D (three-dimensional) images that can be viewed with conventional red and blue 3D glasses. In three appendices, the book describes accessories for the PowerShot S100 camera, including filter adapter, cases, and external flash; gives a list of web sites and other resources for further information; and includes a section with quick tips that give insights into how to take advantage of the features of this camera in the most efficient ways possible. The book includes a detailed Table of Contents and a full Index, so the reader can quickly find information about any particular feature or aspect of the camera.",$36.09,4.6

44276,345498607,book,paperback,The Vagina Monologues,Eve Ensler,Villard," A landmark in women’s empowerment—as relevant as ever after a year marked by unprecedented political protest—that honors female sexuality in all its complexity.""I was worried about vaginas. I was worried about what we think about vaginas, and even more worried that we don't think about them. . . . So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas, to do vagina interviews, which became vagina monologues. I talked with over two hundred women. I talked to old women, young women, married women, single women, lesbians, college professors, actors, corporate professionals, sex workers, African American women, Hispanic women, Asian American women, Native American women, Caucasian women, Jewish women. At first women were reluctant to talk. They were a little shy. But once they got going, you couldn't stop them.""So begins Eve Ensler's hilarious, eye-opening tour into the last frontier, the forbidden zone at the heart of every woman. Adapted from the award-winning one-woman show that's rocked audiences around the world, this groundbreaking book gives voice to a chorus of lusty, outrageous, poignant, and thoroughly human stories, transforming the question mark hovering over the female anatomy into a permanent victory sign. With laughter and compassion, Ensler transports her audiences to a world we've never dared to know, guaranteeing that no one who reads The Vagina Monologues will ever look at a woman's body the same way again.Praise for The Vagina Monologues “Probably the most important piece of political theater of the last decade.”—The New York Times“This play changed the world. Seeing it changed my soul. Performing in it changed my life. I am forever indebted to Eve Ensler and the transformative legacy of this play.”—Kerry Washington “Spellbinding, funny, and almost unbearably moving . . . both a work of art and an incisive piece of cultural history, a poem and a polemic, a performance and a balm and a benediction.”—Variety “Often wrenching, frequently riotous. . . . Ensler is an impassioned wit.”—Los Angeles Times “Extraordinary . . . a compelling rhapsody of the female essence.”—Chicago Tribune",,4.2

44279,1533259720,book,paperback,Crime Stoppers: The Inside Story,"Greg MacAleese, Cal Millar",CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform," In 1976, Detective Greg MacAleese came up with a concept to combat crime. He called the program Crime Stoppers and today it is cited along with fingerprinting and DNA as the top three innovations in modern day policing. The Albuquerque Police Department, which embraced the idea and brought it to fruition, continues to hail Crime Stoppers as the most successful anti-crime program in the history of law enforcement. For MacAleese, who was born in Canada but spent his high school and college years in the United States, Crime Stoppers was like a roller coaster ride, and the book reveals a story, that until now hasn’t been told. Assigned as an investigator to the Violent Crimes Unit only three years after becoming a police officer, MacAleese was in a hospital emergency room watching the life ebb from a 20-year-old victim who was callously shot during a robbery at a gas station. A short time later he promised the mother of Michael Carmen that he would solve the slaying and it was that vow which became the catalyst to launch Crime Stoppers. From an idea to curb lawlessness in what at the time was one of the most crime-ridden and dangerous cities in the United States, Crime Stoppers has grown to a worldwide network of more than 1,600 programs. Accumulatively since 1976, Crime Stoppers has solved 1.5 million crimes, seized $10 billion in illicit drugs and recovered more than $2 billion in stolen property. Most people believe Crime Stoppers is run by law enforcement, but this book explains how programs in various cities are charitable organizations with volunteer boards and operate in partnership with the police, the media and the community.",$21.85,4.9

It has made countless new businesses possible and presents a massive opportunity for large enterprises to innovate like startups and retire decades of technical debt. But making the most of the cloud requires much more from enterprises than just a technology change. Stephen Orban led Dow Jones’s journey toward digital agility as their CIO and now leads AWS’s Enterprise Strategy function, where he helps leaders from the largest companies in the world transform their businesses. As he demonstrates in this book, enterprises must re-train their people, evolve their processes, and transform their cultures as they move to the cloud. By bringing together his experiences and those of a number of business leaders, Orban shines a light on what works, what doesn’t, and how enterprises can transform themselves using the cloud.",$12.99,4.8

With her husband lying terribly injured beside her, Mary watches a set of feet emerge from behind the car they crashed into and walk over to where she is sprawled. One of the feet kicks her in the jaw and she blacks out. When she wakes, she is still at the crash site but on a stretcher. Her husband is on a stretcher beside her and, despite his injuries, is trying to tell her something.  A large crowd has gathered and a number of people are recording the event with their phones. She goes ballistic and attacks them.  When she comes round in hospital, she is informed that her husband died of his injuries. Worse still, the most traumatic event of her life has become a YouTube sensation with footage of her attack on the onlookers being viewed all over the world. Mary learns that the man driving the car in front vanished from the scene. The car was registered under a false name.  She must contact every person she attacked who recorded the event and ask for their help. But somebody is murdering the people who used their hand held devices and is removing their recordings.  Mary must try to reach them before the digital fragments of the event disappear altogether. As Mary moves closer to the truth. she realizes the crash conceals a secret someone will do anything to conceal.",,4.0

In France, the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards look forward to another day of digging endless trenches. In Norway, the Germans are gaining the upper hand against the Allied forces. At sea, German U-Boats are taking a heavy toll of Allied shipping, whilst in London, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain is fighting for political survival. In North-West Europe, hundreds of thousands of men endure the boredom of the 'Phoney War'. Before the end of the month however, some of these men will become heroes. Others will become villains. Many will be dead. As dawn approaches, the ominous roll of thunder sounds far off to the east along the German border. But this is May, and it never thunders in May... does it?",$32.66,5.0

În spatele faptelor de arme, al atrocitatilor si al crimelor monstruoase comise împotriva civililor se ascunde o alta realitate. Aceea a miilor de femei sovietice trimise pe front împotriva inamicului nazist. Svetlana Aleksievici si-a dedicat sapte ani din viata colectarii marturiilor unor femei care, multe dintre ele, la momentul acela erau abia iesite din copilarie. Dupa primele sentimente de euforie, asistam la o schimbare radicala de ton, pe masura ce ajungem la încercarea fatala a luptei, însotita de partea sa de întrebari si de suferinta. Abandonand tacerea în care si-au gasit refugiul, aceste femei îndraznesc, în sfarsit, sa prezinte razboiul asa cum l-au trait. ""Svetlana Aleksievici este unul dintre cei mai valorosi scriitori ai vremurilor noastre. Proza ei nu este feminina, ci aspra precum razboiul [...], dar, prin expresivitatea ei, devine artistica, palpabila, profund emotionanta."" - Vladimir Voinovici Cartile Svetlanei Aleksievici au fost sau vor fi publicate în 43 de limbi si în 47 de tari. ""Razboiul nu are chip de femeie"" s-a vandut în peste 2 milioane de exemplare.",,

44521,812975219,book,paperback,Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets (Incerto),Nassim Nicholas Taleb,Random House Trade Paperbacks," Fooled by Randomness is a standalone book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s landmark Incerto series, an investigation of opacity, luck, uncertainty, probability, human error, risk, and decision-making in a world we don’t understand. The other books in the series are The Black Swan, Antifragile, Skin in the Game, and The Bed of Procrustes.Fooled by Randomness is the word-of-mouth sensation that will change the way you think about business and the world. Nassim Nicholas Taleb–veteran trader, renowned risk expert, polymathic scholar, erudite raconteur, and New York Times bestselling author of The Black Swan–has written a modern classic that turns on its head what we believe about luck and skill. This book is about luck–or more precisely, about how we perceive and deal with luck in life and business. Set against the backdrop of the most conspicuous forum in which luck is mistaken for skill–the world of trading–Fooled by Randomness provides captivating insight into one of the least understood factors in all our lives. Writing in an entertaining narrative style, the author tackles major intellectual issues related to the underestimation of the influence of happenstance on our lives. The book is populated with an array of characters, some of whom have grasped, in their own way, the significance of chance: the baseball legend Yogi Berra; the philosopher of knowledge Karl Popper; the ancient world’s wisest man, Solon; the modern financier George Soros; and the Greek voyager Odysseus. We also meet the fictional Nero, who seems to understand the role of randomness in his professional life but falls victim to his own superstitious foolishness. However, the most recognizable character of all remains unnamed–the lucky fool who happens to be in the right place at the right time–he embodies the “survival of the least fit.” Such individuals attract devoted followers who believe in their guru’s insights and methods. But no one can replicate what is obtained by chance. Are we capable of distinguishing the fortunate charlatan from the genuine visionary? Must we always try to uncover nonexistent messages in random events? It may be impossible to guard ourselves against the vagaries of the goddess Fortuna, but after reading Fooled by Randomness we can be a little better prepared. Named by Fortune One of the Smartest Books of All Time A Financial Times Best Business Book of the Year",$13.28,4.2

But, despite appearances, these are not dogs—they are foxes. They are the result of the most astonishing experiment in breeding ever undertaken—imagine speeding up thousands of years of evolution into a few decades. In 1959, biologists Dmitri Belyaev and Lyudmila Trut set out to do just that, by starting with a few dozen silver foxes from fox farms in the USSR and attempting to recreate the evolution of wolves into dogs in real time in order to witness the process of domestication. This is the extraordinary, untold story of this remarkable undertaking. Most accounts of the natural evolution of wolves place it over a span of about 15,000 years, but within a decade, Belyaev and Trut’s fox breeding experiments had resulted in puppy-like foxes with floppy ears, piebald spots, and curly tails. Along with these physical changes came genetic and behavioral changes, as well. The foxes were bred using selection criteria for tameness, and with each generation, they became increasingly interested in human companionship. Trut has been there the whole time, and has been the lead scientist on this work since Belyaev’s death in 1985, and with Lee Dugatkin, biologist and science writer, she tells the story of the adventure, science, politics, and love behind it all.  In How to Tame a Fox, Dugatkin and Trut take us inside this path-breaking experiment in the midst of the brutal winters of Siberia to reveal how scientific history is made and continues to be made today. To date, fifty-six generations of foxes have been domesticated, and we continue to learn significant lessons from them about the genetic and behavioral evolution of domesticated animals. How to Tame a Fox offers an incredible tale of scientists at work, while also celebrating the deep attachments that have brought humans and animals together throughout time.",$12.69,4.7

In the aftermath of the crisis, families have struggled to survive in a world short on food, water, and electricity. Hyperinflation cripples the United States economy and post-war armored military vehicles are patrolling the streets.

While she takes aim at alpha females, the untold secret is that this book is for all women. The insights and advice she gives will save many marriages."" -- Dr. Scott Haltzman, Distinguished Fellow, American Psychiatric Association, author of The Secrets of Happily Married Women""Suzanne Venker shows that being an alpha woman doesn't need to interfere with love and harmony."" -- Shawn T. Smith, Psy.D., psychologist and and author of The Practical Guide to Men and The Woman's Guide to How Men Think WHAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT FOR YOUR HUSBAND TO CHANGE TO HAVE THE MARRIAGE YOU WANT?America is in love with the alpha female. She's the quintessential modern woman--assertive, razor sharp, and fully in control. Her success in the marketplace is undeniable, a downright boon to society. But what happens when the alpha woman gets married?  She becomes an alpha wife, of course.  An alpha wife is in charge of everything and everyone. She is, quite simply, the Boss. The problem is, no man wants a boss for a wife. That type of relationship may work for a spell, but it will eventually come crashing down.Since 1970, just as women became more and more powerful outside the home--more alpha--the divorce rate has quadrupled. And it is women who lead the charge. Today, 70% of divorce is initiated by wives.  Do men just make lousy husbands? Not at that rate, says cultural critic and Fox News contributor Suzanne Venker. The truth is that women weren't raised to be wives. No one told them their real power lies in their femininity. Being 'strong and independent' sounds good on the surface, but it often translates to being difficult--and no man wants that. There's an art to loving a man, and any woman can master it.An alpha woman herself, Venker learned how to be a wife the hard way--through trial and error. Lots of error. And here's what she knows today: The set of skills a woman needs to pursue a career, or even to raise children, is the exact set of skills that will destroy her marriage. The Alpha Female's Guide to Men & Marriage gives women who are used to being in charge the tools they need to make their marriages less competitive and more complementary. Part memoir, part advice, this brave book argues that while marriage is more challenging for the alpha woman, it's possible to find peace in your marriage. In fact, it's easier than you think.",$13.50,4.2

Today’s future is tomorrow’s reality— the future is on its way! What could happen, when, and how can we prepare?  Contains ""some of the most readable (and movie-ready) scientific literature ever published"" - Neal Ungerleider, writer, FAST COMPANY.  You will get an engaging and thought provoking ride. In future scenarios written to make science and technology readable and intriguing, the author weaves imagination, science, and even occasional dry humor into a gripping whole. The possible future realities described in these speculative essays, with time scales ranging from the current century to nearly eternity, may inspire readers young and old, even thinkers, writers and leaders.  Updated edition. Includes over 400 references and links to more information. Peer reviewed for scientific accuracy.  Here are just some of the topics you will read about:A week’s worth of food can be produced with just one hour of labor, so could we all have lives of leisure?Cognitive enhancement the easy way: from pills to ultrasound to electrical stimulation and more.When computers can read our minds we won’t need WIMP (windows-icons-mouse-pointer) based computers any more.A telepresence robot is a long distance extension of yourself, and some day could allow you to work anywhere while living wherever you want.Colonizing the moon, Mars, and other planets and moons is possible in principle, so how might we actually do it?“It doesn’t grow on trees” is a problem whose future solution is genetically engineered trees.An asteroid ended the dinosaurs and one could end us too, but there are ways to protect against them.These topics and many more (32 independent essays, mostly but not exclusively nonfiction) describe what could happen—and in many cases, what we can do.  “… could inspire ... students to be more creative, their parents and grandparents to be more future aware, and leaders of nations around the world to take heed and act.” —Donald Maclean, MBChB  “As a technology futurist I am extremely interested in the topics of this book. Thank you so much for writing this excellent book!!” —Elina Hiltunen, PhD, CEO  “... whizzes past the future and then loops back to look it in the eye. This is a … brilliant book.” —Sabiha Rumani Malik, President of Sanghata Global  “I have been pleasantly surprised at the quality and depth of the material in this book.” —Luke Hutchison, PhD (MIT), Google; TED fellow; Singularity University alumnus  “Although many foresight and futurism books belong in the science fiction section, Berleant grounds his writing in scientific facts and knowledge, while maintaining the excitement the material deserves. … the book can expand your view of the possible.” —33rd Square",,3.9

For Jude, it is love (and lust) at first sight. For Emeline... not so much. The brief moment sparks a singular obsession in Jude. Determined to have her, he stalks Emeline across the Atlantic, across the breadth of her native America, and across time. More than 150 years later, flitting among the metropolises of 21st century America, the pair is still engaged in an epic game of cat-and-mouse. The world has changed dramatically, but they have not. As always, Emeline runs from Jude and the destructiveness of her vampiric nature he represents. Jude still chases his unrequited love, a symbol of virtue and human sensibilities he is not even aware he desires. Yet, for those with eternity stretched out before them, time becomes fluid — and like a river current, it can wear down even the most unchangeable elements. As Emeline reaches the point where she must decide whether or not to stop running, the dark corpses in Jude’s closet begin cropping up in her present, and it becomes clear his past could be a threat to their future.",$34.00,

The book tells the story of changes that have been taking place in the inner worlds that belong to a collective spiritual destiny and the fate of the planet, changes that are as significant as the ecological devastation even as they are unreported and unacknowledged. It asserts that destruction of the surrounding world, as it continues, is reflected in the inner worlds of all people through a loss of sacred light, and the threat of a soulless wasteland looms large. The book seeks to address readers’ futures as individuals and as a whole, and to inspire people to take responsibility for the earth and reclaim humanity’s sacred role as its guardians.",$14.95,4.0

Each year, the nation's top business schools are flooded with applications from people eager to pursue their MBA dreams. But those aspirations come at a steep price. According to U.S. News and World Report, the average debt load for graduates of NYU's Stern School of Business, MIT's Sloan School of Management, and other top business schools exceeds $100,000. Like most, author Laurie Pickard couldn't shoulder that. But she faced a dilemma: despite two degrees and a Peace Corps stint, she needed a business education to land her dream job in international development. She decided to take her education into her own hands, and found that some of those same prestigious business schools offer MOOCs (massive online open courses) for low or even no cost. By picking the right classes from the best schools, she gained the skills-without all the debt. In Don't Pay for Your MBA, Pickard shows self-starters, career changers, and budding entrepreneurs how to navigate the expanding universe of online education. Building on her popular No-Pay MBA blog, Pickard reveals how to: Define your goals and tailor a curriculum that works for you * Master the language of business * Build a strong network * Choose a concentration and deepen your expertise * Showcase your nontraditional education in a way that attracts offers Self-directed learning fills gaps in your training, positions you for promotions, and opens up new opportunities. Why pay exorbitant tuition when you can MOOC your way to success?",$12.20,5.0

He never suspects there's a secret society of bloodsuckers lurking in the shadows of the main streets and back roads of modern-day America. All that changes one fateful night come dinnertime after a sexy succubus satisfies her hunger by gorging on second helpings of the boy's momma and daddy. Elvis stakes her, then sets out to slay the rest of the children of the night, weaving a bloody path of destruction that stretches from southern mansions to trailer parks, from northeastern goth clubs to the set of a high budget Hollywood splatter movie. With the help of a lunatic millionaire and an Irish Vampire with a serious chip on his shoulder and a set of sharp canines in his mouth to match-Elvis might accomplish just that-unless the trio wind up killing one another before the vampires get there first.",$14.99,4.5

With the help of Jewish friends and mentors, he presents a deeper and more complex Christian faith, offering readers a better vision of the beauty and genius of Christianity, but also an honest look at its warts and failings. Weaving his own story and personal conversations with Jewish friends, Le Donne, a respected scholar and published author, models how his fellow Christians can avoid blurring the differences between Christianity and Judaism on the one hand and exaggerating them on the other.",$3.79,4.2

Have you wondered if they have lost their minds? In Hooks and Ladders, author and ex-Evangelical Christian Billy Wheaton provides keen insights into Evangelical Christians who operate under a different set of rules than the rest of the world with their own language and cultural norms. In this unique approach, Wheaton systematically explains how Evangelicals base their sacred doctrines on the ideas of the Apostle Paul, how Paul's reasoning contains characteristics of paranoid schizophrenia, and how the combination creates problems for Evangelicals. Wheaton further discusses how Evangelical autistic and schizophrenic reasoning leaves Evangelicals with irreparable beliefs and a community that cannot function well. Well-researched and well documented, Hooks and Ladders will help non-Evangelicals understand how Evangelical Christians think. It is a step-by-step journey through American Evangelical Christian culture that explains how believers have become trapped playing a game of Hooks and Ladders and why they cannot easily quit playing.",$13.82,

The USA has just launched its first satellite into orbit. Elvis Presley has been inducted into the US Army. And a little boy named Buddy has just been born into a black and white world. Twenty-four years later, that boy, now a young man, is left in a coma by a car accident. When his father—a devout Nebraska farmer—visits Buddy in the hospital, he discovers they are able to communicate telepathically. Through a week of mental conversations and time travel, they revisit the events and secrets of two decades that made them strangers to each other. A dog with two names shepherds them through the path of betrayal, abuse, and—eventually—reconciliation. Told with devastating simplicity and magic, this small novel will change the way you look at rainbows forever.",$11.99,5.0

45099,022637923X,book,paperback,A War for the Soul of America: A History of the Culture Wars,Andrew Hartman,University Of Chicago Press," When Patrick Buchanan took the stage at the Republican National Convention in 1992 and proclaimed, “There is a religious war going on for the soul of our country,” his audience knew what he was talking about: the culture wars, which had raged throughout the previous decade and would continue until the century’s end, pitting conservative and religious Americans against their liberal, secular fellow citizens. It was an era marked by polarization and posturing fueled by deep-rooted anger and insecurity.   Buchanan’s fiery speech marked a high point in the culture wars, but as Andrew Hartman shows in this richly analytical history, their roots lay farther back, in the tumult of the 1960s―and their significance is much greater than generally assumed. Far more than a mere sideshow or shouting match, the culture wars, Hartman argues, were the very public face of America’s struggle over the unprecedented social changes of the period, as the cluster of social norms that had long governed American life began to give way to a new openness to different ideas, identities, and articulations of what it meant to be an American. The hot-button issues like abortion, affirmative action, art, censorship, feminism, and homosexuality that dominated politics in the period were symptoms of the larger struggle, as conservative Americans slowly began to acknowledge―if initially through rejection―many fundamental transformations of American life.   As an ever-more partisan but also an ever-more diverse and accepting America continues to find its way in a changing world, A War for the Soul of America reminds us of how we got here, and what all the shouting has really been about.",$15.77,4.4

45158,743272560,book,paperback,Ultrametabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss,Mark Hyman,Atria Books," Bestselling author, columnist, and physician Mark Hyman, M.D., brings us a science-based, easy-to-follow diet and nutritional plan in UltraMetabolism: The Simple Plan for Automatic Weight Loss.For many, losing weight is a never-ending struggle, especially since our bodies are designed to keep weight on at all costs; it's a matter of survival. But a medical revolution is under way, showing us how to work with our bodies instead of against them to improve nutrition and ignite the natural fat-burning furnaces that lie dormant within us. Drawing on cutting-edge research about nutrigenomics—the science of how food talks to our genes—Dr. Hyman, author of bestsellers including The Blood Sugar Solution, The Ultra-Mind Solution, UltraPrevention, and The UltraSimple Diet has created a method for losing weight by eating the right foods to detox and manage food allergies. Food contains information and instructions for our bodies: eat the right foods and send instructions of weight loss and health; eat the wrong foods and send messages of weight gain and disease. After spending the last ten years conducting pioneering, hands-on research with over two thousand patients at Canyon Ranch, one of the world's leading health resorts, Dr. Hyman has discovered the seven fundamental causes of obesity. He has integrated his years of research into this groundbreaking approach to help you rebalance and stabilize your metabolism to maintain weight loss and enjoy lifelong health. This isn’t a fad diet. Dr. Hyman explains how to customize your personal health and weight-loss program with a streamlined eight-week plan designed to help you lose weight based on your own unique genetic needs. Menus, recipes, and shopping lists, as well as recommendations for vitamins, supplements, and exercise will help you change your lifestyle and be healthy for years to come.",$8.65,4.4

Chanse isn’t entirely sure he believes the couple, eitherespecially when it turns out some of the art may have been forgeries. The trail of the art leads him to a new gallery on Julia Street in the Arts District opened by a couple new to town that seem to have no past. When one of them turns up dead and the other vanishes, it’s now up to Chanse to find not only the missing art, but a ruthless murderer who will kill anyone who gets in the way.",$16.95,4.4

Many deal with this by telling children that the legends surrounding Santa Claus are based on a real, historical figure named Nicholas, a Christian bishop known for his generosity. This picture book presents a shortened, somewhat fictionalized version of the life of Saint Nicholas, explaining that Nicholas was a servant of God and that, through him, Gods love was reflected to others. The story touches on the ministry of Nicholas and his generous gift of a dowry to three young girls as a response to Gods love in Jesus. And it brings application to our own lives as we, too, respond with grateful hearts to Gods great gift of love to us. Combining museum-quality artwork and family friendly language, this book clearly articulates how God showered His love upon us through Christ and helps children see that our own gift-giving is a grateful response to the sacrificial gift of Gods Son.",$7.99,4.2

There just isn't enough time for everything on our ""To Do"" list—and there never will be. Successful people don't try to do everything. They learn to focus on the most important tasks and make sure they get done.There's an old saying that if the first thing you do each morning is to eat a live frog, you'll have the satisfaction of knowing that it's probably the worst thing you'll do all day. Using “eat that frog” as a metaphor for tackling the most challenging task of your day—the one you are most likely to procrastinate on, but also probably the one that can have the greatest positive impact on your life—Eat That Frog! shows you how to zero in on these critical tasks and organize your day. You'll not only get more done faster, but get the right things done.Bestselling author Brian Tracy cuts to the core of what is vital to effective time management: decision, discipline, and determination. In this fully revised and updated second edition, he provides brand new information on how to keep technology from dominating your time. He details twenty-one practical and doable steps that will help you stop procrastinating and get more of the important tasks done—today!",$14.22,4.6

45395,162006765X,book,paperback,The Most Hated Man in America: Jerry Sandusky and the Rush to Judgment,Mark Pendergrast,"Sunbury Press, Inc."," Everyone knows the story of Jerry Sandusky, the serial pedophile, the Monster. But what if that story is wrong? What if the former Penn State football coach and founder of the Second Mile is an innocent man convicted in the midst of a moral panic fed by the sensationalistic media, police trawling, and memory-warping psychotherapy? The Most Hated Man in America reads like a true crime psychological thriller and is required reading for everyone from criminologists to sports fans. “If potential readers are convinced that Jerry Sandusky is guilty, they need to read The Most Hated Man in America. This meticulously researched, provocative, and wonderfully written book by Mark Pendergrast, an enormously important contributor to the repressed memory debate, will certainly make them see another side. Maybe they will think twice.” -- Elizabeth Loftus, Distinguished Professor of Psychology & Social Behavior, University of California, Irvine, author, The Myth of Repressed Memory and other books. “The Most Hated Man in America tells a truly remarkable story. In all the media coverage the Sandusky case has received, it’s amazing that no one else has noticed or written about so many of these things, including all the ‘memories’ that were retrieved through therapy and litigation. One would think that the sheer insanity of so much of this will have to eventually come out.” --Richard A. Leo, Hamill Family Professor of Law and Psychology, University of San Francisco, author, Police Interrogation and American Justice and The Wrong Guys: Murder, False Confessions, and the Norfolk Four “Virtually everybody knows with certainty that Jerry Sandusky is a serial child molester. He was, after all, found guilty by a jury of his peers. But what if what we think we know about Sandusky is at least in some ways incorrect? Regardless of their ultimate conclusions, readers will find The Most Hated Man in America to be thoughtful and provocative, addressing questions that deserve to be asked in a just society.” --Fred S. Berlin, M.D., Ph.D. Director, The Johns Hopkins Sexual Behavior Consultation Unit, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine",$19.95,4.8

It's Time You Take Control Of It With The Book That Will Show You How.

The Reviews...  From ASCAP  What if you could talk one-on-one with some of the greatest names in music today, like Grammy winning ASCAP songwriter Diane Warren, Grammy winning artist/legendary guitarist/founding member of ""Toto"" Steve Lukather, the famed record engineer and producer Bob Clearmountain, and mastering engineer to the stars Bob Ludwig and others, and they gave you their much sought-after advice on how to make music just like the biggest and best music stars.    In How To Make It In The New Music Business, Robert Wolff not only gives you this information from his interviews with these music legends, but reveals to you the technology and equipment that the ""real music artists and producers"" use to make their hit records and shows you how to use it to make hit sounding major record label quality music and records anywhere.      Think of this book as your ""Music Road Map"" that will take you from where you are to where you want to be, simply by following its step-by-step plan.   Far too many songwriters and musicians spend years and years of their lives becoming great at their craft, but rarely, do many of them know how the real world music game is played, or how to create a hugely successful career and do it all on their own terms. With this book, those days are over.   From Readers...  ""Having received significant interest from DreamWorks, Hollywood and Maverick all within the last three months, I have fast come to the realization of which you have categorically confirmed for me in your book.

Well written and inspiring it is a very enjoyable read for anyone just starting out in the business or veterans who wish to touch up on all aspects of the industry. I enjoyed the inspiring words from Bob Clearmountain and Bob Ludwig.""  --Brian T.    ""Recently I was looking for a book to learn more about the music business, contracts, marketing, new ways of distribution, etc. I encountered this book and decided to get a sample into my Kindle and read the first chapter. After that I bought it and kept reading. The book is divided into different lessons, which are organized in a logical manner analogous to the way you go into starting a business, producing and album and selling it. The book covers a lot of material and it is written in a very friendly way, easy to understand. If you are interested in music and music business you will definitely find some sound advice and a lot of inspiration in this book. It opened my mind in many ways.""  --J.P. Mantilla  ",,3.9

Written by the founders of the architecture, design, and research firm Filson and Rohrbacher, this book takes you through the basics of CNC fabrication, the design process, production, and construction of your own furniture designs. Through their AtFAB series of projects, accompanied by an overview of digital techniques and design thinking, this book introduces the knowledge and skills that you'll find widely applicable across all kinds of CNC projects. Not only will you learn how to design, fabricate, and assemble a wide range of projects, you'll have some great furniture to show for it! While 3D printing has been grabbing headlines, high school, college, library, and other public makerspaces have been making things with CNC machines. With a CNC router, you can cut parts from strong, tactile, durable materials like wood. Once you have your design and material, you can set up your job and let it run. When it's done, you can put the project together for an heirloom of your own. While 3D printing can make exciting things with complex designs, CNCs are the digital workhorses that produce large-scale, long-lasting objects.",$23.79,4.2

Officially named Haida Gwaii, the islands are home to the proud and talented Haida First Nation. The twists and turns of the plot revolve around three intertwining love stories. Will the stories of the three heroines, Libby Campbell, Dr. Shirlee, and Willow Shaw answer the questions, ""Does love happen when one least expects it? Is falling in love only for the young? Can love overcome obstacles to a happily-ever-after?"" Love in the title refers to more than romance. Along with their friends, these strong yet vulnerable women form a ""family"" that crosses cultures, generations, and borders. Love, therefore,  also includes relationships with friends, family, community, culture, and the environment. Enjoy your journey to the Misty Isles. Born and raised on the Canadian prairies, Rosemary Vaughn immigrated with her family to the northern plains of the United States in the mid-1970s. A former professor of Teacher Education, her published works have focused on academics. Returning to her love of creative writing, she recently had poetry and prose pieces published in a literary anthology. Turning to fiction, Rosemary has drawn on her experiences in education and living on the islands in her debut novel Love on the Misty Isles. Now retired, she and her husband enjoy spending time with friends and family in Minnesota and Florida. Visit Rosemary at her website: www.rosemaryvaughn.com. ",$14.07,5.0

Thrust between this struggle are Simon Kovalic, the Commonwealth’s preeminent spy, and Kyle Rankin, a lowly janitor happily scrubbing toilets on Sabaea, a remote and isolated planet. However, nothing is as it seems. Kyle Rankin is a lie. His real name is Eli Brody, and he fled his home world of Caledonia years ago. Simon Kovalic knows Caledonia is the site of a top-secret Illyrican superweapon project and that the past Brody so desperately tried to abandon can grant him access to people and places that are off limits even to a professional spy like Kovalic. Kovalic needs Eli Brody to come home and face his past. With Brody suddenly cast in a play he never auditioned for, he and Kovalic will quickly realize it’s everything they don’t know that will tip the scales of galactic peace. Sounds like a desperate plan, sure, but what gambit isn’t?  The Caledonian Gambit is a throwback to the classic sci-fi adventures of spies and off-world politics, but filled to the brim with modern sensibilities.",$8.97,4.6

They're a fun way to develop your creativity and jump start your ability to think and react quickly, especially in situations where things are happening very fast.In some, you may need to suspend your disbelief to play along. Some will make your head spin. Others may make your heart pound. Still others will make you go hmmm. But all will challenge you to think outside your comfort zone, to look for solutions from different angles, and to not necessarily limit yourself to what you see and what the obvious solution could be. They will stretch your mind and help you to develop your ability to formulate a solution in situations where you must quickly decide upon a course of action and there's little available information to work with.* * * * * * *""I took this to my office and we spent several lunch hours going over the possibilities. It is really fascinating to see others flex their comfort zones to come up with answers using creative problem solving skills. There are no right answers. You are on your own to work with the facts presented. Not just fun or thought provoking, it leaves you wanting to go through the entire book.""",$14.95,4.0

45910,1464209200,book,paperback,Death at the Durbar: The Second Maharaja Mystery (The Maharajah Mysteries),Arjun Gaind,Poisoned Pen Press," December, 1911. All of India is in a tizzy. A vast tent city has sprung up outside the old walled enclave of Mughal Delhi, where the British are hosting a grand Durbar to celebrate the coronation of the new King, George V. From across India, all the Maharajas and Nawabs have gathered at the Viceroy of India's command to pay homage and swear loyalty to the King Emperor, the first monarch of England to travel out to India personally.Maharaja Sikander Singh of Rajpore is growing increasingly bored, cooling his heels at the Majestic Hotel as he awaits George V's arrival. Just as his frustration is about to peak, a pair of British officers shoulders in. They insist that he accompany them to the British Encampment. Irked, but his curiosity piqued, Sikander agrees. To his surprise, they take him to the King Emperor's quarters where Sikander's old school friend, Malik Umar Hayat Khan, the Durbar herald, awaits. Malik Umar is serving Lord Hardinge, the Viceroy and the highest-ranked Englishman in the country. Lord Hardinge, overruling several subordinates, tells Sikander that his services as a sleuth are needed by King and country. Sworn to secrecy, Sikander is ushered into George V's personal chambers.And there he finds the cause for his extraordinary summons - an exquisite nautch-girl, hanged until dead. Employing techniques he has learned from studying Eugene Vidocq and Sherlock Holmes, Sikander examines the scene and demonstrates the girl was not a suicide, but murdered.Her death at the very heart of the encampment could ruin the enormously costly celebration and spark deep political repercussions in India and in England. Under this pressure, the Viceroy hands Sikander both the case to solve and a ticking clock - he must complete his investigation before George V arrives. And under the surveillance of one Captain Campbell of an elite British regiment.The list of suspects and motives is too large, the number of hours for the task too few. But he gave his word and so the Maharaja must put his skills to work. In the end, Sikander wishes he had not.The Maharaja Mysteries are perfect reading for fans of Tarquin Hall, Barbara Cleverly, and the late HRF Keating - and Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Coyle.",$10.84,3.7

She senses danger crawling towards her when she encounters a strangely self-possessed member of the unit hosting their exchange exercise in Britain. When a blackmailing letter arrives from a woman claiming to be her husband Conrad's lost daughter and Conrad tries to shut Carina out, she knows the threat is real. Trying to resolve a young man's indiscretion twenty-five years before turns into a nightmare that not only threatens to destroy all the Mitelae but also attacks the core of the imperial family itself. With her enemy holding a gun at the head of the heir to the imperial throne, Carina has to make the hardest decision of her life...",$15.99,4.7

Scott Boren, Ralph W., Jr. Neighbour",Touch Publications," (This book is a revised & expanded edition of Making Cell Groups Work) TOUCH Outreach has worked with thousands of churches and pastors. Throughout the years, we've made a few key discoveries, which are explained in great detail in How Do We Get There From Here?... -Success with holistic small groups happens when the members of the first groups are fulfilling the unique mission of your church. -Congregational assimilation is a stage six goal, not something you should try immediately. -The transition requires the senior pastor's personal and long-term involvement. -Team implementation is far more successful than a single individual calling the shots. -The transition to holistic small groups is a values shift, not the launching of a new program. These findings are just a small sample of what you will discover in this practical, step-by-step book on holistic small group or cell group implementation! ""We'll just do what XYZ Church did"" We receive calls from pastors who went to a big church's annual small groups conference, then returned home to launch groups. Most call because they now have groups that are not growing with new leaders or new Christians. If they had only read this book and followed Scott's advice! While we highly recommend visiting other churches doing small groups to learn, we've found that your journey into HSG-based ministry will be vastly different from any other church's pilgrimage. Therefore, your plan of action must be unique as well! How Do We Get There From Here? has the information you need to both understand the process and implement it in your unique congregation. Is this the transition process for you? There are dozens of introductory books on small groups and cell groups, which are excellent reading. But this book is unique. It explains the transition process in a way that guarantees healthy, holistic small groups proven to work in any kind of church.",$15.11,5.0

46116,864922914,book,paperback,Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia,Michael Haynes,Goose Lane Editions," Michael Haynes is Mr. Hiking in Nova Scotia. The 7th edition of his Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia sold 15,000 copies, and his eight-year series of CBC Radio spots has been so popular that people he meets on the trails recognize him by his voice. Eager to supply the best information about the delights (and possible hazards) of self-propelled excursions into the woods and mountains and along the shores of his province, he has now prepared Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia, 8th edition. The 8th edition of Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia is completely revised and updated. More than 30 of the 50 trails are new, and 25 of these new trails did not exist when the 7th edition was published. Haynes re-hiked and updated the descriptions of about 20 trails, and he charted the current condition of 7th-edition trails. Users will find the new 8th edition of Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia as trustworthy a guide as ever to hikes long and short, challenging and easy, in all corners of the province. As well as instructions for finding each trail and descriptions of the trails themselves, Hiking Trails of Nova Scotia, 8th edition, includes maps and synoptic information on length, time, difficulty, other uses, facilities, and the correct topographical map to use. New to this edition are trailhead GPS listings for all hikes, and, for those who carry cellphones as safety devices, information about the often-uncertain reception in Nova Scotia's mountains and woodlands. Also new to this edition are sidebars on plants, animals, historic sites, and other interesting features of the trails.",,3.4

Kathy Bacus, author of Calamity Jayne When Caro Lamont, former psychologist turned pet therapist makes a house call to help Kevin Blackstone with his two misbehaving German Shepherd dogs, she expects frantic dogs, she expects a frantic dog owner, she even expects frantic neighbors. What she doesn't expect is that two hours later the police will find Kevin dead, his dogs impounded; and that as the last person to see Kevin alive (well, except for the killer) she is suddenly a person of interest, at least according to Homicide Detective Judd Malone. Detective Judd Malone scanned my living room, his baby blues taking in my overstuffed couch, easy chairs and crowded bookshelves. My cats, Thelma and Louise, perched in the window sill, replete with tuna. Each opened an eye and then, unimpressed, went back to their beauty sleep. Dogbert climbed from his doggie bed, trotted over for a sniff, but then also dismissed Malone and went back to his nap. ""Can I get you something to drink?"" I asked.  Some hospitality is automatic. Even when you have an unannounced guest. Even a guest who might arrest you. He shook his head and continued his scan.  ""Well, then. What can I help you with, Detective?""  ""I understand you visited Kevin Blackstone today?""  ""Yes, I did. I'm the behavioral counselor for his German shepherds. What about Kevin?"" I had a really bad feeling about this. Malone arched a brow. ""Kevin Blackstone is dead."" Sparkle Abbey is the pseudonym of two mystery authors (Mary Lee Woods and Anita Carter).

Bill Gates, Bono, and Laura Bush are only a few of the personalities who have lent their names--and opened their pocketbooks--in hopes of stopping the disease. Still, in a time when every emergent disease inspires waves of panic, why aren't we doing more to tame one of our oldest foes? And how does a pathogen that we've known how to prevent for more than a century still infect 500 million people every year, killing nearly one million of them?  In The Fever, journalist Sonia Shah sets out to answer those questions, delivering a timely, inquisitive chronicle of the illness and its influence on human lives. Through the centuries, she finds, we've invested our hopes in a panoply of drugs and technologies, and invariably those hopes have been dashed. From the settling of the New World to the construction of the Panama Canal, through wartimes and the advances of the Industrial Revolution, Shah tracks malaria's jagged ascent and the tragedies in its wake, revealing a parasite every bit as persistent as the insects that carry it.   With distinguished prose and original reporting from Panama, Malawi, Cameroon, India, and elsewhere, The Fever captures the curiously fascinating, devastating history of this long-standing thorn in the side of humanity.

But Akira is sure that her ability is just a genetic quirk and the ghosts she encounters simply leftover electromagnetic energy. Dangerous electromagnetic energy.Zane Latimer believes in telepathy, precognition, auras, and that playing Halo with your employees is an excellent management technique.

Connie works in the hospital's kitchen, laundry, and central supply departments while learning to take care of and comfort sick patients, various treatments for the common diseases, and how to get along with people--the other students, the patients, and her superiors.

Now Carly’s sister Sabrina is missing, and Ainsley returns to Dahlonega, Georgia for the first time since the homicide that tore her family apart. Ainsley must face the ghosts of her past as she tries to repair her present relationship with her remaining family, including Ben Paulson, the county sheriff – who isn’t too keen on having his criminal defense attorney cousin nosing around his investigation. Especially not when Ainsley inadvertently hooks up with Callum Elias, Ben’s high school nemesis and a man with a questionable past. With Cal’s help, Ainsley begins to piece together the connection between Carly’s murder and Sabrina’s disappearance – a connection that grows stronger as a chain of violent events suggests that someone in Dahlonega is getting very nervous. As Cal and Ainsley’s relationship heats up, the cold case which has haunted her family for so long shows distinct signs of thawing. But can they solve the mystery – and find Sabrina – before the killer claims another victim?",$16.99,4.8

Iniciado en enero de 2009, el proyecto se convirtió rápidamente en una sensación en Internet. Fue expandido gradualmente llegando a contener más de 40 mapas sobre los estereotipos, los que el autor describe como caricaturas cartográficas que ridiculizan los peores excesos de la mentecatez intolerante. Los ensayos que acompañan estos mapas narran la historia del proyecto y contemplan las aventuras con los prejuicios que acompañan al hombre desde el alba de la civilización. Éstos ofrecen una perspectiva más profunda pero igualmente hilarante en cuanto a nuestra tendencia inherente a culpar a los demás al azar por las nimiedades más insignificantes. De acuerdo con este libro, el primer animal domesticado no fue el perro sino el chivo expiatorio. La ironía afilada y punzante del autor te guiará a lo largo de los espejismos de las antiguas civilizaciones de Grecia y China, te revelará la pasmosa amalgama de supersticiones y de paranoia de la Edad Media y te dejará deseando más y más con la predicción grotescamente cómica sobre el futuro de Europa. En raras ocasiones nos llegan la sátira y la cartografía en un solo ejemplar, pero en el Atlas de los prejuicios éstos se funden victoriosamente para consumar un libro que es incendiariamente cómico y perturbadoramente incitante al razonamiento profundo, todo al mismo tiempo.",$17.59,

Imagine asking your children questions that spark discussion. In ""More Than Four Questions,"" master educator Sharon Marson has collected questions asked her by children over the years, about the Exodus from Egypt, about the Passover holiday, and about the Seder ritual itself. These questions make a great jumping off point for Passover discussion. Beneath the questions is a broad expanse of white space - where children preparing for the holiday can write or draw their answers to the questions. This book also collects answers given by children to these questions, answers rich with spiritual depth and creativity.""A beautiful enhancement to any Seder. I loved reading through Sharon Marson's new guide to our Hagaddah. I rethought basic questions that had lost their meaning to me. She pushed me to open my heart and mind, with an extreme gentleness, through her enormous humility and disarming manner, to re-experience a connection to goodness, holiness, kindness, purposefulness, and be helped through the process with the voices of our children."" -- Rabbi Binyamin Krauss, principal, SAR Academy""'More Than Four Questions' will take families on a journey of learning and reflection, bringing the larger-than-life events and ideas of our heritage to bear on the world that we experience today. The combination of structure and openness provides an ideal framework for turning your Seder into a very special educational experience."" - Rabbi Naphtali Harcsztark, principal, SAR High School""This book opens a wide door to questions of all sorts and sizes and makes ample room for a variety of answers. What a treat to read the profound ideas of children and adults alike about the Seder experience and the Pesach story as well as Sharon's spiritually engaged commentary."" - Dr. Wendy Zierler, professor of modern Jewish literature, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion",$7.35,3.5

46644,1936587408,book,paperback,Marcelino And The Curse Of The Gold Frog,Sr. Daniel Chavez,Brighton Publishing LLC," Marcelino was born in a remote Mexican village in the late 1800s. Life was tolerable until his loving mother's death, when his conniving father gave him to an uncle. The uncle took him to his farm in Texas, where his wife and sons refused to accept Marcelino into the family-and they torturously worked him like a beast of burden. Running away from his miserable existence, he found freedom glorious, but it did not ease his constant nightmares. Little did he know that those vile accomplices of the night had a more sinister plan. Ruination would soon devour his dreams and damnation would rule his entry into adulthood. Marcelino's wife, Maria, never knew her father; tequila and a fast gun took his worthless life before she was born. Although his death allowed her to happily enjoy her childhood, her adult life included a first husband who put an end to her contentment. What he did to Maria scarred her mentally and physically-and forever changed her life. Marcelino inherited the consequences of those scars. Marcelino and Maria had married soon after they met; but then WWI intervened. To provide for his family, Marcelino returned to the farm in Texas. He and Maria were trapped, mistreated, and ultimately forced to leave in search of work. Years of crisscrossing Central Texas yielded only extreme poverty, racism, and incomprehensible hardships. Marcelino eventually found work in San Marcos, and his steady employment greatly improved their lives. What he failed to notice was a hellish nightmare taking shape as Maria developed telekinesis. The women of the town suspected her of being a sorceress, and an incident at church confirmed their suspicions. Angered, they retaliated by hiring a Comanche witch to ""fix"" Maria. A crowded churchyard provided the setting for a confrontation that triggered Maria's madness. Her escalating violent behavior soon singled out her newborn son. What she planned for him and for all of her childrenwas genuine insanity.",$12.95,5.0

Knopf," DON’T MISS BRIDGE OF CLAY, MARKUS ZUSAK’S FIRST NOVEL SINCE THE BOOK THIEF.  The extraordinary #1 New York Times bestseller that is now a major motion picture, Markus Zusak's unforgettable story is about the ability of books to feed the soul.  Nominated as one of America's best-loved novels by PBS’s The Great American Read.  When Death has a story to tell, you listen. It is 1939. Nazi Germany. The country is holding its breath. Death has never been busier, and will become busier still. Liesel Meminger is a foster girl living outside of Munich, who scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she encounters something she can’t resist–books. With the help of her accordion-playing foster father, she learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.  In superbly crafted writing that burns with intensity, award-winning author Markus Zusak, author of I Am the Messenger, has given us one of the most enduring stories of our time.   “The kind of book that can be life-changing.” —The New York Times   “Deserves a place on the same shelf with The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank.” —USA Today",$11.69,4.6

But when he realized he was gay, those hopes were called into question. The Bible, he’d been taught, condemned gay relationships.    Feeling the tension between his understanding of the Bible and the reality of his same-sex orientation, Vines devoted years of intensive research into what the Bible says about homosexuality. With care and precision, Vines asked questions such as:    • Do biblical teachings on the marriage covenant preclude same-sex marriage or not?  • How should we apply the teachings of Jesus to the gay debate?  • Can celibacy be a calling when it is mandated, not chosen?  • What did Paul have in mind when he warned against same-sex relations?    Unique in its affirmation of both an orthodox faith and sexual diversity, God and the Gay Christian has sparked heated debate, sincere soul search­ing, and widespread cultural change on the issue of what it means to be a faithful gay Christian.",$12.74,4.3

46737,345505344,book,paperback,Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet,Jamie Ford,Ballantine Books," In the opening pages of Jamie Ford’s stunning debut novel, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, Henry Lee comes upon a crowd gathered outside the Panama Hotel, once the gateway to Seattle’s Japantown. It has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has made an incredible discovery: the belongings of Japanese families, left when they were rounded up and sent to internment camps during World War II. As Henry looks on, the owner opens a Japanese parasol.This simple act takes old Henry Lee back to the 1940s, at the height of the war, when young Henry’s world is a jumble of confusion and excitement, and to his father, who is obsessed with the war in China and having Henry grow up American. While “scholarshipping” at the exclusive Rainier Elementary, where the white kids ignore him, Henry meets Keiko Okabe, a young Japanese American student. Amid the chaos of blackouts, curfews, and FBI raids, Henry and Keiko forge a bond of friendship–and innocent love–that transcends the long-standing prejudices of their Old World ancestors. And after Keiko and her family are swept up in the evacuations to the internment camps, she and Henry are left only with the hope that the war will end, and that their promise to each other will be kept.Forty years later, Henry Lee is certain that the parasol belonged to Keiko. In the hotel’s dark dusty basement he begins looking for signs of the Okabe family’s belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot begin to measure. Now a widower, Henry is still trying to find his voice–words that might explain the actions of his nationalistic father; words that might bridge the gap between him and his modern, Chinese American son; words that might help him confront the choices he made many years ago. Set during one of the most conflicted and volatile times in American history, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is an extraordinary story of commitment and enduring hope. In Henry and Keiko, Jamie Ford has created an unforgettable duo whose story teaches us of the power of forgiveness and the human heart.""Sentimental, heartfelt….the exploration of Henry’s changing relationship with his family and with Keiko will keep most readers turning pages...A timely debut that not only reminds readers of a shameful episode in American history, but cautions us to examine the present and take heed we don’t repeat those injustices.""-- Kirkus Reviews“A tender and satisfying novel set in a time and a place lost forever, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet gives us a glimpse of the damage that is caused by war--not the sweeping damage of the battlefield, but the cold, cruel damage to the hearts and humanity of individual people. Especially relevant in today's world, this is a beautifully written book that will make you think. And, more importantly, it will make you feel."" -- Garth Stein, New York Times bestselling author of The Art of Racing in the Rain“Jamie Ford's first novel explores the age-old conflicts between father and son, the beauty and sadness of what happened to Japanese Americans in the Seattle area during World War II, and the depths and longing of deep-heart love. An impressive, bitter, and sweet debut.”-- Lisa See, bestselling author of Snow Flower and the Secret Fan",$12.00,4.6
